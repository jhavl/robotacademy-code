00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.809
Here again is our simple two-linked planar robot and what we're going to do now is to

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.630
consider the end effector velocity as a function
of a very specific set of joint velocities.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.950
That's the set of joint velocities that have
got a magnitude of 1. We can think about this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.140
geometrically. What we're interested in is
the set of all velocities that lie on this

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.930
red circle. Here is a general point Q that
lies on that circle. Points here and here

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.760
corresponds to motion of joint 1 only and
points here and here corresponds to motion

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.289
of joint 2 only. All the other points in the
circle correspond to a mixture of motion of

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.890
joint 1 and of joint 2.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.710
Another way we could write this constraint
that the velocity lies on the red circle is

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.589
in terms of this vector, vector product. It's
the same as the dot product. Same dot product

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.560
of Qdot with itself is equal to 1. We have
an expression for Qdot in terms of the Jacobian

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.500
matrix inverse and the velocity of the robot
end effector. So I can substitute this expression

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.010
for Qdot into the above and I get a complex
expression that looks like this.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.830
What does that mean? Well this is the equation
for an ellipse. It's an ellipse in the velocity

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.110
space. So in the coordinate system xdot and
ydot, what we have here is an expression for

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.650
an ellipse. So this is a particular velocity
on that ellipse xdot and ydot. What happened

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.260
is we've mapped a set of velocities in the
joint space which was a circle into a set

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.790
of velocities in the end effector velocity
space and that is an ellipse. What this says

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.040
is that the robot was able to achieve quite
a high speed in the y direction but a relatively

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.400
low speed in the x direction. So it can go fast in the y direction and more slowly in the x direction.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.760
Now this ellipse that I've drawn is a function
of the joint angle configuration. The shape

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.540
of the ellipse depends on the way the robot
joint angles are configured.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.840
Let's have a look at the example to get the intuition behind this. Once again, this is our two-linked robot.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.720
And if I moved joint 1 then the end of link
1 will move with the velocity like this. And

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.200
if I move joint 2 then the end of link 2 will
move with the velocity like this. The end

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.910
effector velocity is the vector sum of these
two velocities. We can add the two vectors

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.700
together and this is the resultant.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.240
And what we see in this particular configuration,
the robot was able to move more quickly in

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.370
the vertical direction than it can do in the
horizontal direction. So for equal joint velocities,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.170
we will in general get an even velocity in
the different Cartesian directions. This depends

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.090
on the robot's configuration.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.000
Let's have a look at how the robot's velocity
ellipse changes shape as the robot's configuration

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.510
changes. I've imported a model of the two-linked
planar manipulator. I plotted and I created

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.069
a teach window here. So we can see the blue
panel on the side has got a couple of sliders

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.200
that allow me to change the joint angles of
the robot. This is a plain view. A top down

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.150
view of the robot manipulator.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.930
First thing I'm going to do is to adjust the
joint 1 slide a little bit. Here we can see

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.160
the robot's velocity ellipse. It's very, very
skinny indeed. That's because the robot is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.450
at a near singular condition. We see that
in configuration like this, the robot is able

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.010
to move quite quickly towards the left and
the right. But it's almost completely unable

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.030
to move either upwards or downwards. The configuration here is close to singularity and similarity

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.090
came about when the second joint angle was
very close to 0. Let me increase the second

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.030
joint angle. What's going to happen now is
that the ellipse gets wider and wider.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.160
The robot is further away from singularity and
is now in a configuration of joint angles

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.459
that allows it to move quite readily along
the direction of link 2 or orthogonal to link

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.690
2. Now if I reduce the second joint angle,
Q2, make it close to 0, we see that the ellipse

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:33.130
is going to get skinnier and skinnier. Ultimately
it will become an ellipse of 0 with a straight line.
