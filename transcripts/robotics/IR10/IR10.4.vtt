00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.910
We're going to do a bit of a recap of simple
dynamical systems and we're going to start

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.330
with the very classical system which is a
mass on wheels connected by a spring to a fixed point.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.320
The displacement of the cart with respect
to some data is given by the variable X. And

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.640
X increases positively to the right. If the
spring is compressed then it's going to push

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.399
the cart towards the left. And the direction
indicated by the arrow and the symbol Fs.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.780
That's the force exerted by the spring. Now
we can imagine the situation where this spring

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
is stretched and that's the case when X is
negative. And now the spring is trying to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.579
pull the cart towards the right. And so the
arrow indicating the direction of Fs is now

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.920
pointing towards the right. So the spring
can either push or pull the cart and the spring

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.469
force is equal to minus K times X, the way
I've drawn this particular diagram.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.030
Now there's friction operating and friction
is a force that opposes the direction of motion.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.340
So in the top figure, if the cart is moving
towards the left, then the friction force

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.770
is going to be towards the right and vice
versa for the figure below that. And the friction

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:26.400
force is proportional to the velocity, proportional
to ẋ. And B is the friction coefficient.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560
In order to understand this we're going to
draw a free body diagram. So here I have a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.380
mass M and its displacement X. And there were
two forces acting on the mass. There is the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.080
spring force Kx and the friction force Bẋ.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.710
The acceleration of the body is equal to the
sum of the forces that are acting on it. And

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.640
I can rearrange this expression into this
form here. So this is a second order linear

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.140
differential equation which describes the
motion of the mass M.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000
Now if you're a little bit rusty on solving
your differential equation, let me give you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.640
a hint. We can propose that X is equal to
E to the ST. That it is an exponential function

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.390
of time. And S is the time constant.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.469
Now I could take the derivative of this, and
I got an expression now for ẋ. And with

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:20.029
some simplification I can see that ẋ is
equal to S times X. And I can take the derivative

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:25.769
again and get this expression here. Now I
can make these substitutions into my original

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.019
equation and I end up with this expression
and I can cancel out the X's and I end up

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.069
with this, which is called the characteristic
equation. This is now a quadratic equation

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.049
in the variable S. And we can solve for S
quite easily.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.239
Here is the quadratic equation again and the
well-known solution to the quadratic equation

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.209
is here. These values of S are known as the
poles of the system. And they define the response,

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.199
the position response of the mass as a function
of time. And remember X is an exponential

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.639
function of time and S.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.480
If we consider the determinant of this equation,
that's the expression inside the square root.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.209
It has three interesting sets of values. If
the determinant is greater than zero then

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.529
S has two real and different values. If the
determinant is equal to zero then S has two

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:24.829
real and equal values. Two values of S are
the same. And if the determinant is less than

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.959
zero, then S is a complex conjugate pair.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.229
In terms of the physical response of the system,
this case is referred to as the damped response.

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:39.639
This case is called critically damped. And
this case is an oscillating response. The

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.629
overall response, the position of our mass
as the function of time is the superposition

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.669
of the response due to each pole. So it's
some constant, times the response of the first

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.040
pole, plus some constant times the response
due to the second pole.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.999
A very classical way to consider the response
of a second order dynamical system such as

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.609
we're studying here is to look at it's damping
ratio and that's given by this expression

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.939
here. And the graph shows the time response
for different values of damping ratio. When

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.499
the damping ratio is greater than one, we
say that the response is over damped. We see

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:21.989
that it responds very very slowly as a function
of time. When the damping ratio is less than

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.770
one, we see that the response is somewhat
oscillatory. And as the damping ratio get's

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.400
smaller and smaller we see that the system's
response is more and more oscillatory. The

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.310
over shoot is higher and there are more cycles
of oscillation.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.949
When the damping ratio gets to zero there
is no decay at all. And the system will continue

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:47.340
to oscillate forever without any kind of decay.
The damping ratio 1 corresponds to critical

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.979
damping. It is the smallest value of the damping
ratio for which there will be no overshoot.

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.800
Consider now we want to simulate the response
of this differential equation. I can rearrange

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.689
it so that ẍ is isolated by itself on the
left hand side. And now I am going to start

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.800
to draw of block diagram of a system which
has got the same dynamics as our differential

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.259
equation. I'm going to draw an arrow and label
it ẍ. And I'm going to add an integrator

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.099
we integrate ẍ. And now I have ẋ. And
I'm going to integrate it again and now I

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:31.199
have X. The signal ẋ and multiply it by
minus b then I have compute this term here.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.939
And the triangle indicates a gain block. It's
output is equal to minus b times it's input.

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:43.710
Then we introduce another gain block here
with a gain of minus K. If I add these two

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.490
signals together with a summing junction,
the result now is this expression shown here

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.900
in yellow. And if I divide that by M, that
is by applying a gain of 1 on M, I have now computed

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.770
an expression that is equivalent to ẍ.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.400
So I joined the output of this gain block
to the signal that I started with. So this

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.539
is a block diagram of a dynamic system. And
if I built this in a simulation environment

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.289
and simulated how it performed as a function
of time, the signal X is going to give me

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.530
the position response of the dynamic system
that we looked at in the first place. The

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.819
system with a cart and a spring and some friction.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.030
Well this is the system that I just described
but I implemented it in the Simulink modelling

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:36.370
package that's a part of MATLAB. Here are
the two integrators; the integrator that integrates

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:44.670
the ẍ into ẋ that is acceleration to velocity and this integrator which integrates velocity into position.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.740
This particular integrator has got an initial
condition of 1. That's the initial value of

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:56.460
the displacement X. That's the initial position
of the cart. So the way we define our coordinate

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.860
conventions means that for X=1, the spring
is compressed. That means the first thing

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.889
that the spring is going to do is to push
the cart away. It's going to push the cart

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.539
into -X direction.

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:14.979
So let's simulate the model as we have it
here. And here we see the position response

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.159
of the cart. As I just said a moment ago,
the cart is moving in the -X direction. It's

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:24.379
oscillating a little bit but the energy is
decaying from the system and it settles out

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:27.870
at a position of X=0.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.289
Now I'm going to adjust some of the parameters.
This gain block here represents the inverse

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:37.479
mass so I can open up the parameter settings
here and I'm going to change the mass from

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:44.460
2 kg to 4 kg. And I'm going to apply that
parameter. And now I am going to simulate

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.509
the response. You'll note that it changes.
We'll see that the oscillations are in fact

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:54.669
more intense. And that's because our system
starts with a greater amount of potential

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:59.099
energy. That's the energy stored in that compressed
spring.

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:04.520
More mass is going to have more initial potential
energy, which is going to take longer to be

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:12.539
dissipated by the friction. If I increase
the mass even more, turn it up to 2 kg, apply

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:20.289
that, and here we see that the oscillation
has become much slower and it's also the rate

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.199
of decay is much much less.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:28.340
I'm going to do now is to put that back to
the value I started with which was 2 kg, simulate

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.340
the original system that looks like this.
And now what I'm going to do is to increase

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.870
the amount of friction.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.539
So originally we had a friction coefficient of
2 and changed the friction coefficient to

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.659
4 and what we should see is that the oscillation
should die out more quickly because the energy

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:49.589
is dissipated much more quickly because there
is an increased amount of friction; increase

00:08:49.589 --> 00:08:56.170
it some more, increase it say to 8, and apply
that parameter and simulate again and there

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.290
we see. There’s absolutely no oscillation
at all now. The system is over damped.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.510
So let's recap on how we convert differential
equation to an algebraic equation. I make

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:14.310
these substitutions for X and it's derivative
ẋ and ẍ in terms of S and X. Now it's

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.610
possible that we can consider S as an operator.
That is it's an operator that converts differential

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:25.709
equation to an algebraic equation. Once we've
done this we can solve for S and we call these

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:30.920
values of S the poles of this system. And
they indicate the dynamic response of the

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.459
system as a function of time. If a system
has got more than one pole, the system we

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:42.120
looked at has two poles, then the response is the
superposition, the summation of the response

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.320
due to each particular value of S.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.959
What we considered earlier was called the
unforced response. There was no other force

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:55.680
acting on the system apart from the spring
and the friction. We position the cart at

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:02.120
some initial value of X not equal to zero.
And then let it go and watched what happens.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.120
Now what I'm interested in is what's called
the forced response. Now I'm going to apply

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.000
a force F to the cart and I want to understand
how it moves. So I draw the free body diagram

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.060
again but now it's got an extra force. It's
got the force that I'm applying to the cart

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.860
F as well as the spring force and the friction
force. Now I consider the force balance acting

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.779
on the mass in the free body diagram and rearrange
it like this. Now I'm going to consider S

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:35.180
as an operator. I'm replacing the derivatives
of X with the operator S and now I'm going

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.870
to write this. And you'll notice a few differences.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:43.000
Firstly the derivatives have gone and I've
introduced my operator S. You'll also notice

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.620
that I've changed the lower case x to a capital
X and I've changed the lower case f to a capital

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.250
F. What I've done is computed the Laplace
transform of my differential equation. Capital

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:59.959
X represents the Laplace transform of the
position of the cart lower case x and capital

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:06.579
F represents the Laplace transform of the
applied force which is lower case f.

00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:12.329
Now I can rearrange my Laplace transform expression
into a ratio which we call a transfer function.

00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:19.649
It is the ratio of the output of the system
X to the input of the system F. And to make

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:24.720
things very clear I've said that capital X
is the function of the operator s and capital

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.940
F is a function of the operator s.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.079
Let's consider a very general dynamic system
as a black box. The input is a signal x which

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:39.660
is a function of time and the output is another
signal y which is a function of time. Then

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:45.940
mathematically the output of the system y
is related to the input to the system x, convolved

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.520
with the impulse response of that dynamic
system, which is denoted by g as a function of time.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.259
In the Laplace domain where we've just been
operating, things are a little bit simpler.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:02.500
The Laplace transform of the input system
is capital X. Laplace transform output is

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.290
capital Y. And G is the transfer function
of the system.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.870
So now the output Y is simply the product
of the input X multiplied by the transfer

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.720
function. The simple multiplication in the
Laplace domain where it is a convolution in

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.899
the time domain.

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:24.620
I've covered a lot of territory in this section.
And if you previously encountered these concepts,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:30.319
I hope that it served as a bit of a memory
refresher for you. If you've never encountered

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:35.050
these concepts before then what I've been
talking about is probably a little bewildering.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.279
It might be worthwhile trying to go through
the content again. Perhaps contact a friend

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:44.329
or colleague who can talk you through some
of this material or try and find an introductory

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:48.889
control systems text which will cover this
material in much much more detail.
