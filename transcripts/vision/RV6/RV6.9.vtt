00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.780
Consider that we are viewing this object.
It is being illuminated by a white light source

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.289
and the camera is returning these RGB values
or tristimulus values. Imagine now that the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.029
intensity of the white light source is being
reduced. What we observe is that the appearance

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.340
of the object changes but clearly the color
of the object itself cannot change because

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.540
the color is a material property of the object—an
apple is still red, even if it is in a dark

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.519
room—and what we observe is that as the
lighting level has been reduced the tristimulus

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.890
values have changed; they have all become
smaller, but the ratio between the tristimulus

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.269
values remains the same and what we would
like to do is to find some way to transform

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.129
the three tristimulus values to one brightness
value and perhaps two color values.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.960
One way to do this is to transform the RGB
values into chromaticity coordinates and we

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.990
divide the RGB values by the sum, by the total
tristimulus, we end up with these variables,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.890
little R, little G and little B. And it is
easy to show that these vary between zero

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.869
and one. It is also easy to show that they
sum to one. Therefore, one of the coordinates

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.860
is redundant and typically we consider just
the little R and little G values.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.649
Consider this worked example, similar to things
we have looked at before: white light falling

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.960
on to a red apple and producing this tristimulus
value. Now consider that there is a cloud

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.930
in front of the light source, the overall
illumination level has been reduced and the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.009
tristimulus value now has a different value,
smaller tristimulus value then we had before.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.799
Let’s consider a worked example: in the
first case we can compute the chromaticity

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.460
coordinates of little R and little G. For
the second case where there was a cloud in

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.710
front of the light source, lower overall illumination,
we can compute the chromaticity coordinates

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.719
and we can see that they are the same and
what we have been able to do then is to factor

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.489
out the effect of intensity and retain just
two numbers which provide some representation

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.319
of color.
Let’s consider a two dimensional coordinate

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.500
system with the axis little R and little G.
This point where R equals one and G equals

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.840
nought corresponds to pure red. Where R equals
nought and G equals one corresponds to pure

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.750
green and this point at the origin where R
and G are both equal to zero corresponds to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.560
pure blue.
It is not possible for a chromaticity coordinate

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.430
to exist in the space above the blue line
and this comes from the constraint that little

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.269
R, plus little G, plus little B has to equal
one.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.480
In an earlier lecture we discussed the concept
of gamma encoding this is where there is a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.360
non-linear transformation between the brightness
of the light entering the camera and the magnitude

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.080
of the signal leaving the camera. Almost all
cameras today have gamma encoding in them

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.340
and the gamma value is typically around 2.2.
What effect does gamma encoding have on chromaticity

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.959
coordinates? We will illustrate this with
another worked example.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.159
We will use the tristimulus or RGB values
from the earlier example with the full sun

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.549
and the clouded sun illumination and the first
step is to compute the gamma encoded RGB values,

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.640
and they are shown here, and we can do this
very easily and conveniently using MATLAB.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.819
Now let’s compute the chromaticity coordinates
and in the first case it is for the full illumination

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.680
condition and here are the R and G values.
For the second case with lower illumination,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.709
we compute the chromaticity coordinates and
we see they are the same as for the first

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.780
case. So once again we have factored out the
effect of illumination and we are left with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.530
two numbers which represent the color. For
this case with gamma encoding, we have factored

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.860
out the effect illumination and that is a
good thing. But the actual chromaticity coordinates

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.760
have a different value to the case we computed
earlier without gamma encoding.
