00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.990
In this section we're going to look at computing
the derivative of an orthogonal rotation matrix.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.600
One of the properties of an orthogonal matrix
is that it's inverse is equal to its transpose

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.200
so we can write this simple relationship R times it's transpose must be equal to the identity matrix.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.200
First off I'm going to consider the simple
case of a rotation by the angle theta about

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.649
the X-axis. I can take the derivative with
respect to theta and using the chain rule

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.920
I can write this. Applying this identity I
can rewrite it in this particular form and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.649
I can simplify it by introducing the symbol
S to represent this expression here.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.679
The matrix S has an interesting property. If
I add it to its transpose the result will

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:55.480
be equal to zero. And this kind of matrix
is referred to as a skew-symmetric matrix.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.730
That property of the skew-symmetric matrix
can also be written like this. So this kind

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
of matrix is also sometimes referred to as
an anti-symmetric matrix.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.430
These matrices are always singular that is
that it determines is always equal to zero.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.070
Any matrix can be written as the sum of a
symmetric matrix and a skew-symmetric matrix.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.390
In three dimensions the skew-symmetric matrix
has this form. It's got a very distinctive

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.190
zero diagonal and there are only three unique
elements in this matrix x, y, z and each of

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.060
them appears with a positive sign and a negative
sign. Now the interesting characteristic of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.060
the skew-symmetric matrix is itâ€™s a way to
write the vector cross product relationship

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.840
as the product of a skew-symmetric matrix
computed from the vector A multiplied by the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.660
vector B. So cross product can be turned into
a matrix vector product.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.080
Here's our earlier expression for S and I
can write down an expression for a matrix

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.230
which represents rotation about the X axis
by the angle theta. If I substitute these

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.960
values in, and simplify I end up with a very
simple matrix containing a lot of zeroes one

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.040
and a minus one. Recalling our earlier expression
for a skew-symmetric matrix this matrix that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.100
I've just written down I can write as a skew-
symmetric matrix of the vector [1 0 0]. So the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.390
derivative of a rotation matrix with respect
to theta is given by the product of a skew-

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.730
symmetric matrix multiplied by the original
rotation matrix.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.700
I can perform the algebraic manipulation for
a rotation around the Y axis and also for

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.640
a rotation around the Z axis and I get these
expressions here and you can clearly see some

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.640
kind of pattern. Now let's consider the general
case. A rotation about the vector L by an

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.830
angle theta and it can be shown that this
is equal to the product of a skew-symmetric

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.260
matrix computed from the vector L multiplied
by the original rotation matrix.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.330
If I now multiply both sides of the expression
by dee theta dee T, that's the rate of change of theta,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580
I can write an expression like this.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.240
What this is, is a time derivative of a general rotation matrix.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.569
A rotation of theta about the vector L is
equal to a skew-symmetric matrix computed

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.819
on the vector Omega multiplied by the original
rotational matrix.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.850
Omega in this case is the angular velocity
vector. It is the rate of change of angle

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.939
multiplied by the vector direction about which
the rotation is occurring.
