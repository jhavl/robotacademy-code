00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.589
It's going to be useful to say a little bit
more about the point correspondence problem.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.910
Here we have again the initial view of our
triangular object and here we have the final

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.270
view, or the desired view, of our triangle
object.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.400
When the points move in the image plane it's
possible for them to move like this and this

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.039
is the example that we just looked at a moment
ago. But it's also possible for the points

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.390
to move like this and if they did that then
the motion of the object in three dimensional

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.219
space is going to be much more complex. It's
almost going to require the object to flip

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.260
around in the three-dimensional world.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.649
Another way we could define the correspondence
is like this and again it involved a different

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.440
kind of three-dimensional motion.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.579
And finally we could have this particular
way of point moving on the image plane.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.379
Each different way of associating a yellow
dot with a red dot is going to result in a

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.979
different motion in the three-dimensional
world. The net result will be the same in

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.090
the image plane but the actual three-dimensional
motion will be different.
