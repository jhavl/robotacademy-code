00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.509
So sometimes it's useful to have your own
co-ordinate frame, and there's a few ways

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.650
you can go about creating them. One of the
simplest is to simply print out this sheet

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.670
from my website and cut it out. So let's do
that.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.700
Now you need to fold it.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.340
Along the dotted lines.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.240
Then a little bit of glue or a staple.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.220
Voila! My co-ordinate frame. A red one.
