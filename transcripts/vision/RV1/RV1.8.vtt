00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.750
We have talked a bit about the human visual
system. Let’s have a look at the way some

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.612
other animals do it.
Consider the case of the bee. The bee is a

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.360
very small animal and therefore it has got
a very small brain. The bee’s brain weighs

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.239
just one gram and it has only got 106 neurons.
So contrast that with the human brain, which

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:27.869
has got one and a half kilograms of grey matter
and 1011 neurons. The bee brain is much smaller,

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.440
much simpler, yet it is still able to do very
complex tasks based simply on the information

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.100
that comes from its eyes.
Now we have two eyes and the bee has two eyes.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.390
There is nothing that says that all animals
have to have two eyes. So this is a close

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.309
up of a spider and this particular spider
has got four eyes and I think there are some

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.390
spiders that have got five eyes. So evolution
has come up with many different designs of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.149
eyes themselves, and configurations of eyes,
that clearly confer some particular advantage

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.880
to the organism that is carrying them.
Here is a close up photograph of the eyes

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.250
of an insect. These are compound eyes, made
up of a number of polygonal facets.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.829
Here is another type of compound eye. This
one doesn’t have quite the field of view

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.720
of the one we just looked at.
Here is the eye of a nautilus, which is quite

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.051
a primitive ocean-going animal. And the eye
really is a very simple pinhole camera; it

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:38.670
doesn’t have a lens as such.
Here are the eyes of a scallop. So the blue

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.430
objects that you can see, each of those is
a very simple eye and it has got a large number

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.219
of them around the outside of what is effectively
its mouth. Each of these eyes is a bit like

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.000
a reflecting telescope. The inside of those
blue objects is quite shiny and so incoming

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.729
light rays, instead of refracting in through
a lens, reflect off the shiny surface inside

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.479
that eye and fall onto the photoreceptors.
So this scallop, it uses reflection rather

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.770
then refraction and it has got a very large
number of eyes.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.820
This is the eye of a squid and it has got
a lensed eye like we have, and it has evolved

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.140
completely independently of the lensed eye
that we have.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.110
And here is a close up of the eyes of a bird.
The compound eye in the insect contains a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.320
number of facets; individual light sensing
elements called ommatidia and if we look at

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.550
a cross-section of the ommatidia it has got
effectively a lens on top which funnels any

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.790
light that falls on it down inside this conical
cell which contains the light sensitive chemicals,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.900
which emit a neural pulse when light falls
on it. So each one of these is effectively

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.360
a single pixel camera, or we can think of
it in those terms. And we have a whole array

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.520
of them pointing in slightly different directions
and that allows the insect to create a fairly

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.040
large field of view.
