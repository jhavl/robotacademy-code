00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.059
Today we take it completely for granted that
we know where we are at all possible times

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.970
and that's thanks to GPS technology that's
embedded into all sorts of devices; it's in

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.590
my phone, it's in navigation systems in cars
and so on, but it wasn’t always like this.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.460
GPS is actually a fairly recent phenomenon.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.460
GPS works by a large constellation of satellites,
24 satellites in space, sending down radio

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.640
signals which are received by the little GPS
receiver chips embedded into all these devices.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.260
Now, these satellites are very, very complex
they contain atomic clocks and they are absolutely

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.539
massive. Now, this technology was originally
developed by the US military to help them

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.219
work out where all their assets and where
all their soldiers were at any particular

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.289
point in time, really key ability in the business
of war fighting to know where everything is.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.880
It’s also particularly useful for civilians
and driving and so on, but it was not the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.580
first application of GPS; it was strictly
military.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.380
Now, in the year 2000, President Clinton signed
an order which made the high accuracy GPS

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.259
capability available to everybody on the planet.
Previously, the high accuracy was only available

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.579
to military users and for everybody else the
service was deliberately degraded, so it told

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.820
you roughly where you were, but with an accuracy
of 100 meters or something like that.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.990
So, this was a revolution and the fact that
he made this order, turned off this deliberate

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.780
dilution of GPS accuracy is what’s enabled
this great revolution in location based services

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.649
that today we take for granted. So, it is
a fairly recent phenomenon, important to keep

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.780
that in mind.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.310
Now, other countries who don’t want to be
reliant on the US-based GPS system, create

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.039
their own satellite based navigation systems
and Europe, Russia, and China are all putting

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.900
in place or have in place alternatives to
the GPS system. So, there are lots of satellites

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.810
up there providing navigation signals that
allow receivers on the ground to know exactly

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.100
where they are.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.690
Now, a long time ago before there was GPS
was the problem with how did you know where

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.670
you were and this was a particularly important
problem during the Cold War. How do you send

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.330
your nuclear bombers to another country to
deliver pay loads if you can’t work out

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.800
where they are, particularly accurately, and
it’s also a real problem under water because

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.230
these GPS signals don’t penetrate water.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.220
So, if you’re a submarine under the water
surface, working out where you are is quite

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.880
complex; you certainly can’t rely on GPS
navigation. If you want to go to the moon

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.010
and we did go to the moon, sent men to the
moon a long time ago, how do you navigate

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.970
around the moon where there is no GPS system?
And back then, there was no GPS system around

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.380
planet Earth and certainly there was no GPS
navigation system around the moon.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.040
So, the way you do that is what’s called
inertial navigation, and this is a technique

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.900
that was pioneered by this gentleman, Charles
Stark Draper, back in the 1950s and the 1960s,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.700
and he was in fact declared Time Man of the
Year in 1961 for his contributions to engineering

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.820
knowledge, particularly this inertial navigation
technology.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.980
So, inertial navigation technology relies
on measuring continuously the acceleration

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
of the body, so if I had the sensors on me
that measured my acceleration and other sensors

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.090
called gyroscopes which measure my rotation.
By processing the accelerating signal and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.060
the rotation signal, combining them with some
pretty clever algorithms, I can work out at

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.250
any point in time where I am. This technology
was pioneered, was driven by the Cold War

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.030
that existed at that particular point in time.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.720
This is the first inertial navigation system;
it was a massive piece of kit and it was able

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.140
to a guide bomber from the east coast to the
west coast of the United States, very, very

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.259
big piece of equipment, and there was an underwater
version of this which was used to accurately

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.199
navigate submarines for long periods of time
underwater, so they could accurately get from

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.719
one place to another just using this navigation
technology.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.760
Another instance of this inertial navigation
technology is what got the Apollo space craft

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.470
to the moon, so that they’re able to miniaturize
this massive inertial navigation system and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.820
shrink it down to a box that was about one
foot, cubed, and that’s what got the vehicle

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.530
to the orbit around the moon and also got
the vehicle then from the lunar orbit down

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.670
on to the surface of the moon and back up
again, and this was in 1968.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.380
So, phenomenal technological progress from
an idea to a massive sensor through to a relatively

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.690
small sensor that could be used for landing
men on the moon.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.050
Today inertial navigation system is almost
a commodity. It’s reduced to the size of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.300
a single chip, and these inertial navigation
chips, which contain accelerometers and gyroscopes

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.530
are embedded into devices like our phones;
this is how our phone knows whether it’s

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.260
in portrait mode or in landscape mode. It’s
how we use it to play games just by moving

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.900
the phone around, these are all done with
inertial navigation technology. Smart toys,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.889
like this quadrotor here, use inertial navigation
sensors to keep the vehicle balanced in space

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.450
and to keep it stable.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.240
They’re used in many, many, many, many technologies
and many, many applications. So, in this particular

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.810
lecture, we’re going to talk about how inertial
measurement systems work.
