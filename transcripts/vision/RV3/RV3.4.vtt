00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.550
Histogram normalization is a common technique
that is used to enhance fine detail within

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.740
an image.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.449
The cumulative histogram is computed from
the image intensity histogram.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.640
Each column in the cumulative histogram is
computed as the sum of all the image intensity

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.190
histogram values up to and including that
grey level, and then it is scaled so that

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.670
the final value is 1.0.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.950
And what you will notice with the cumulative
histogram is that it is very steep when the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.350
input histogram is quite large, and it is
fairly flat when the input histogram is quite

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.920
low.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.500
So we can see here a couple of areas where
the cumulative histogram has grown quite quickly.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.080
Now we use the cumulative histogram as a mapping.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.970
So for every input value, and these unsigned
integer pixel values in the range 0 to 255,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.780
I take an input pixel x and I map it through
the cumulative histogram and I get the result.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.640
So my function of x is a non-linear mapping
through the cumulative histogram of the image.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.030
So the result of this on the Mona Lisa image
is to enhance a lot of the fine detail.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.310
So if we have a look into the background we
can see areas where it is fairly dark in the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.870
original image and where the histogram normalization
has increased the local contrast; made it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.110
possible for us to see detail that otherwise
we could not see very easily in the input

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.350
image.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.260
This is another example of a monadic image
processing operation.
