00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.580
To record a three dimensional scene on a two dimensional surface requires some skills, some insight

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.420
into both geometry and mathematics. And if
we look at the sorts of drawings that are

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.869
done by young children or the cave paintings
of our ancient ancestors, it's clear that

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.449
they didn't have the required insight. The
drawings that they do are very simplistic

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.240
and they don't really capture the third dimension.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.730
In fact, it took humanity quite a long time
in order to come up with an understanding

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.780
of how to do this. So this is a painting that
I love very much from the early renaissance

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.010
era and it shows, very clearly, that the underlying
geometry mathematics has been beautifully

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.320
captured because when we look at this painting,
which is after all only two dimensional, it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.190
inspires in us as viewers, a very vivid three
dimensional perception.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.510
In order to achieve this realism, we need
to understand the underlying geometry. And

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
in this particular drawing here, we can see
a lot of the geometric construction lines

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.729
put in place by the artist, in order to ensure
that the geometry of the final painting will

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.380
be correct.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.630
This was elevated to a very popular art form
in France and what we see here is what looks

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.460
like an image of a rural landscape viewed
through a stone window in the wall of a building.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.729
Of course this is just an illusion. It is
a two-dimensional painting on the wall of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.450
a house. This is a modern version of it, a
street art version of it. And what this appears

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.700
to show is a portal through a building, beyond
which we can see some of the famous New York

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.290
bridges, but again it is just a two-dimensional
illusion, but this time on a very massive

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.329
scale.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
Now these kinds of illusions are very, very
popular and there are a bunch of people who

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.600
do wonderful chalk street art,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.719
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.840
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.969
 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.750
and
these illusions have got a very vivid three

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.780
dimensionality to them,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.939
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:05.119
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.130
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.840
an enormous amount
of work must go into creating these pieces

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.160
of art. you
can't image how much chalk is involved in

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.940
creating an image like this.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.989
But what's going on here is these paintings
have all been created in such a way that the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.580
stimulus that is generated on the retina of
our eyes is exactly the same as the sort of

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.860
stimulus that would be generated by looking
at a real three dimensional scene. So it's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.980
the same stimulus that's supplied to the retina
of our eye and our brain then is interpreting

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.420
it in the normal way that it goes about interpreting
the three-dimensional world. It understands

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.280
something about scale, that things that are
far away are small and things that are close

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.660
appear to be larger.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.319
So all of the knowledge that we have built
up in our brains about the three-dimensional

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.530
world that we actually live in, is tricked
into interpreting this sensation in a three

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.680
dimensional way.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.269
So even if the original scene is three-dimensional
we can still play tricks on our eyes and at

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.409
first glance all of these pictures are somewhat
surprising and then the rational part of our

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.310
brain kicks into play and say's "No, the cup
can't be that big. It must be that the cup

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.879
is close and the person is far away. It can't
be that the little girl is holding tiny people

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.640
in her hand. Tiny people do not exist.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.030
So it must be that they're full size people
far away and that the girl is close to us."

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.810
So the initial reaction is one of surprise
but then when we start to reason about it,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.980
we understand what's going on in these scenes
and I thought It's be fun to play this game

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.980
as well, so here's my friend Chris dancing
on the tip of my finger, but of course Chris

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.629
is a full size human being, in fact he's talker
than I am.
