00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.410
Let’s summarize what we have learned in
this lecture and there are some important

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.349
messages that I’d like you to take home.
The first and perhaps the most important is

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.410
that robots are real. Yes, there are many
depictions of robots in fiction, in books,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.859
TVs and movies, but there are a number of
real robots in the world doing useful things

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.119
right now. The next message is that robots
are very diverse in their form and their function.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.269
They don’t necessarily look like the fictional
robots that you are familiar with. We have

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:38.040
seen a great diversity of real world robots.
We have seen robot arms that are used in manufacturing

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.620
plants. We have seen robots with wheels. We
have seen robots with legs. We have seen robots

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.399
that can fly and we have seen robots that
can move under water or robot boats that can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.270
move on the surface of water. We have looked
at robots that perform a wide range of different

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.340
functions.
And, the form of the robot, that is its shape

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
and how it moves through the world depends
very much on the function that it needs to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.100
perform. So, if it needs to move through the
air, then its form is of a flying machine,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.860
perhaps like a fixed wing aircraft or perhaps
like a helicopter. If it’s got to move across

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.860
the surface of a lake, then it’s going to
have a form that looks like a boat. The functionality

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.880
of robots is improving very, very rapidly.
If we look at manufacturing robots from the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.000
1960’s and compare it to a robot today,
the modern robot is incredibly reliable, incredibly

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
accurate and built for quite a reasonable
price. We see the same thing for mobile robots.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.720
We look at robots like the Stanford Cart or
Shakey from the ’60’s and compare that

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.349
to a Google car of today. That’s a phenomenal
amount of progress in a period of about 50

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.349
years.
The other message that I’d like you to take

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.869
home is that robots are part of the solution
to some really important problems of our time.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.780
They are going to be a key to providing affordable
health care to the growing number of people

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.670
on our planet. They are going to be important
in industries which supply the fundamental

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.810
raw materials for all the people on our planet,
that’s food and energy and minerals. They

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.290
will also have a really key role in managing
and inspecting all of the infrastructure on

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.080
which our modern society depends. Finally,
they play a really important role in monitoring

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.760
the health of the planet on which we all live.
For all of these reasons, robotics is a really

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.470
important technology. It’s an important
technology today. It will only become a more

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.050
important into the future.
