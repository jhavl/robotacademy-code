00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.519
Just to recap we have a camera, which is observing
an object in three-dimensional space. We can

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.160
project the position of the object in 3D space
into the image plane where it has a coordinate

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.910
U, V. Assume that the camera is able to move
and it has translational velocity and rotational

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.340
velocity. The velocity of the point on the
image plane is related to the camera spatial

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.710
velocity by the image Jacobian.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.210
We can demonstrate this principle very simply.
If I move my head to the right then the robot

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
and everything else in the world appears to
move to the left. If instead I rotate my head

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.059
towards the right then everything in the world
also tends to move to the left.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.579
So there's an ambiguity between moving my
head; pure translation to the right and the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.590
rotation of my head to the right. The visual
appearance is somewhat similar.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.660
There are two important concepts that we need
to be aware of. The first issue is perceptibly.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.979
In general as the camera moves, points on
the image plane move as well.

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.619
So there are some cases where with the camera
moving some points in the image plane will

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.570
not appear to move. In that case we say the
motion is imperceptible. Looking at the image

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.350
we are not able to tell whether the camera
is moving or not.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.860
Another important issue is what we call ambiguity
and that is at sometimes quite different camera

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.950
velocities cause the same change in the image.
And we will give some concrete examples of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.240
both of these effects shortly. Consider the
case where the camera is moving in the positive

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.159
Z direction we have this radiating pattern
of optical flow that we introduced earlier.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Let's consider we have an image plane point
right in the middle of the image plane. We

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.470
can see that the optical flow vectors get
larger as we move away from the centre. In

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.570
fact at the very centre there is no apparent
velocity. But, if I am heading directly towards

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.930
an object it doesn't appear to be moving to
the side or upwards or downwards; it's stays

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.259
exactly where it is.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.970
This is the thing that I am going to hit if
I keep moving in the positive Z direction.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.010
So if I just look at a point in the middle
of the image plane; it's not possible for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.129
me to determine whether I am moving forwards
or not.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.129
Another example of imperceptible motion is
the case where the camera is rotating around

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.760
its optical axis. So again if I consider a
point in the image plane there is no apparent

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.319
velocity at this particular point with the
camera rotating.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.150
Clearly if I consider a point toward the edge
of the image there is a significant velocity

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.550
component due to the camera rotation. But,
in the centre of the image there is none and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.650
I cannot tell by looking at a point there whether my camera is rotating around the optical axis or not.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.780
Let's compute the visual Jacobian but, this
time we are going to do it about the point

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.319
which is in the centre of the image. And that is at coordinate 512, 512 that is the principle point.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.430
That's where the optical axis pierces the
image plane and we can see that up here in

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.920
the parameters of the camera object.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.390
We will compute the visual Jacobian at this
particular point, now let's take a look at

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.970
what happens when we move the camera and start
again with motion in the "X" direction. We

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.400
transpose that and we see again that this point moves at 160 pixels per second in the negative "U" direction.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.390
Now let's see what happens if we move in the
"Z" direction and we see now that this particular

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.489
point is going to have a zero velocity.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.250
So my camera is moving forward at a meter
per second and as far as that particular point,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.400
its projection image plane; it's not moving
at all. And the same thing happens in the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.470
case of rotation around the optical axis.
We see again, this particular point has got

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.720
zero motion on the image plane.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.909
Motion ambiguity is an interesting thing.
If we look at the optical flow field due to

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.720
positive velocity in the "X' direction; we
see that all that all the optical flow vectors

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.260
point towards the left.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.599
If I were to rotate the camera in a positive
direction around the "Y" axis we get the flow

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.900
field shown here on the right. And we can
see that they look quite similar. They are

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.930
certainly very similar in the middle rows
of the image, but we can see at the top and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.610
the bottom of the image that for the camera
rotation case the optical flow vectors appear

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.470
to be slightly curved, they are not all parallel as they are in the case of pure velocity in the "X" direction.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.979
There is some sort of ambiguity between translation
and rotation. If I translate the camera or

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.000
I rotate the camera we get somewhat similar
optical flow fields. Let's explore this in

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.610
a little bit more detail.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.880
On the left we see the optical flow due to
pure camera translation. On the right hand

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.320
side we have the case for the camera rotating
around the "Y" axis. The top graph shows the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.970
case when the camera has a lens with a large
focal length. This corresponds to a telephoto

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.130
or a zoom lens. And we see in this case that
the optical flow patterns are very, very similar

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.699
indeed. However, if we use a lens with a small
focal length that corresponds to a wide field

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.169
of view we see that the optical flow pattern
now is very, very different to the pattern

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.400
due to pure "X" translation. This ambiguity
in fact depends on the focal length of the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.520
lens. We can explain this by looking in some detail at the structure of the image Jacobian matrix.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.889
Consider the case where the camera has translation
velocity in the "X" direction. Then that velocity

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.840
multiplies this column of the image Jacobian.
The ambiguous case occurs with rotation around

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.229
the "Y" axis and omega "Y" multiplies this
column of Jacobian matrix.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.380
For the case where "F" is very large a long
the focal length; then these two terms become

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.960
quite similar. So what happens in this case
because "F" is very large it dominates "U'

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.500
squared. So the result is effectively a constant.
It's no longer a function of "U" and the same

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.910
for the first column the corresponding term
it is not a function of "U". So these two

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.759
terms become similar functions.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.650
If we look at the second row we can see that
it has "F", becomes very large and it is in

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.160
the denominator. This term will approach zero
and again becomes very similar to the corresponding

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.090
elements in the first column of the image
Jacobian matrix.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.050
We can take an intuitive approach to this
problem. Here we have a very wide field of

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.919
view image of a cathedral that corresponds
through a very small focal length lens. And

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.750
here we see a narrow field of view image of
same cathedral and that corresponds to a large

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.600
focal length lens; a big zoom lens, a telephoto
lens if you'd like.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.780
Now that large focal length lens corresponds
to the central part of this wide field of

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.669
view image. So in this central part of the
wide field of view image where the "U" and

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:06.270
"V" coordinates are small we get this motion
ambiguity. We can't tell whether the camera

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.449
is rotating or translating. But, even in the
periphery of the image where U and V are large,

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:17.900
the motion is not ambiguous at all. Camera
rotation and camera translation cause very,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:25.100
very different optical flow phenomenon. This ambiguity is very definitely related to the focal length.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.020
Clearly rotational motion and translational
motion are very, very different. But, what

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.810
we've just been saying is that using an image
sensor; just like our eye that it is not possible

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.970
for us to tell in general the difference between some rotational motions and some translational motions.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.100
Surely this would be a showstopper for using
vision to control robots. And it is a bit

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.849
of a problem and one way to get around that
is to use a separate sensor to measure rotation.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:59.349
So this is a picture of a rotational measurement
unit which has got gyroscope sensors in it

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:05.690
which can measure independently the rotation
of a robot and we can use this extra information

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.160
to disambiguate the information that we get
from our visual sensor.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.720
But, what about us? We have our eyes and clearly
for us we can easily determine if we are rotating

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.810
or whether we are translating. Yes we can,
but to do that we also use inertial sensors.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:29.129
We actually have rotational sensors in our
head. In our inner ear there are these three

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:34.680
semi-circular canals and they measure the
angular velocity of our head and we have three

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.000
sensors in our left ear and three sensors
in our right ear. And our brain fuses the

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.920
rotational information that comes from our
inner ear with our optical flow information

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.320
that comes from our eyes.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.370
It is fused in our brain it gives us a very
unambiguous information about our motion whether

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.320
we're rotating or whether we are translating.
