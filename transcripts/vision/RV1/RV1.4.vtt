00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.559
Let’s continue our discussion about the
sense of vision. One of the things that makes

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.450
vision such a powerful sensor is that it is
a long-range sensor. It allows us to sense

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.769
the world beyond our fingertips. Our fingertips,
our arms only allow us to reach and explore

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.999
a relatively small part of the space that
is around us. But sometimes the most important

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.479
things that we need to know about are far
beyond the reach of our fingertips; by the

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:36.870
time things are that close it is perhaps too
late, so vision allows us to see for tens

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.920
of meters, hundreds of meters, a very great
distance and that is a really big virtue of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.910
the sense of vision.
Another important characteristic of a sense

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.149
of vision is that it provides a very rich
amount of information. We know something about

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.699
the shape of the object, we know something
about the colour of the object, and that shape

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.679
and colour in addition to texture allows us
to classify the object to work out what sort

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.360
of thing it is. Is it a thing that we are
interested in? Is it something we want to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.670
run away from? Or we want to move towards?
What sort of object it is, and that is absolutely

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.450
critical for many, many applications for people
and also for robots.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.950
Another great advantage of vision is it gives
us information about motion and it tells us

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.930
about how things are moving around us, so
we can see an object and we can see it moving.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.860
Is it getting closer to us, is it going further
away? But it also provides a lot of information

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.439
about how we are moving, so as we walk through
the world other things appear to move past

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.640
us due to our own motion.
The fact that so many animals use vision and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.500
that the sense of vision has evolved independently
multiple times here on planet earth argue,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.420
I think, for the effectiveness of the sense
of vision. For almost all animals we use the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.109
sense of vision for the really important things
in life. We use it to help us find food, we

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:10.700
use it to avoid being eaten by other animals
and we use it to find our mates. So all the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.410
important life functions are mediated through
the sense of vision.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.110
Have a look at these tasks being preformed
by a variety of different animals. Consider

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.390
the bee, and a bee is a small animal, with
a very small brain, but it has got two eyes.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.690
Quite complex eyes, very different sorts of
eyes to ours, but it can perform quite complicated

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.280
functions. It can fly for a long distance
in order to locate some flowers that other

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.000
bees have informed it about. It can land on
a moving flower or it can tell the difference

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.290
between a flower and a leaf. So quite complex
functions critical to the life of the bee

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.280
and its colony are performed essentially using
vision.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.140
In the middle, we have somebody catching a
ball. They are using their eyes to catch the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.260
ball. They are not using GPS or any other
kind of technological sensor. This person

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.560
has got their eyes on the ball and that is
a very well-known expression. Watching the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.200
ball as it moves through the air and they
have got some sort of mental model about how

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.040
balls move through the air. They are using
that, then, to plan how their hands should

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.530
move in order to achieve a successful grasp
of the ball. So we are using our eyes to sense

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.980
the ball. We are making a plan and then we are acting, we are moving our hands in order to intercept it.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.370
And the last example is driving, where we
are using our eyes to observe the road, people

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.060
and cars that are moving on the road. We’ve
got an idea of where it is we want to go.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.030
So we are using the visual information with
a goal in mind. We are making a plan about

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.710
how to navigate down this particular bit of
road and then we are acting by turning the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.030
steering wheel, pushing the brake pedal or
the accelerator.
