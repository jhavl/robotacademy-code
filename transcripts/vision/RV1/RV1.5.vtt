00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.230
So life appeared on planet earth about 3.6
billion years ago. But for the bulk of that

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.650
time, organisms, life on the planet, was not
able to see. Around 500 million years ago

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.460
there was a revolution in the technology of
life and the sense of vision appeared, and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.400
it appeared very quickly across a number of
species and it led to a great diversity in

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.950
the forms of life. So at this point 500 million
years ago called the Cambrian explosion when

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.210
suddenly all these vision-enabled life forms
started to roam the planet.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.199
One of the earliest and perhaps most successful
of those life forms is the trilobite, and

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.059
here I have a fossilised trilobite. They appeared
500 something million years ago and they lived

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.819
on the planet for something like 270 million
years. So they are an animal with a segmented

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:04.640
body and they had two fairly primitive, by
modern standards, compound eyes. And the sense

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.330
of vision gave animals a competitive advantage.
If an animal could see another animal, perhaps

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.850
it was a hunting animal and it wanted to prey
on that other animal, if it had a sense of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.200
vision it had a real advantage, it didn’t
just have to blindly bump into it. He can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.910
actually see where that animal is and go after
it and consume it. And similarly if you were

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.040
a prey animal, the sort of animal that someone
might want to eat, then if you had a sense

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.610
of vision and you had eyes then you could
sense a predator coming and you could take

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.640
some evasive action. So vision led to this…
almost an arms race on planet earth as predators

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.450
and prey animals gain the sense of vision
and they improved the sense of vision until

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.570
we have the sort of very sophisticated vision
in very, very many animals today.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.890
So the sense of vision appeared on planet
earth about 540 million years ago. And when

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.020
it appeared it was a game changer. In fact,
the sense of vision was so effective that,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.420
over time, ten different sorts of eye designs
have evolved. For instance, the lensed eye

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.700
that we have, the compound eye that a insect
has, the strange reflector based eyes that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.390
scallops have and so on. So there are ten
different designs of eyes on the planet. And

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.990
the lensed eye, like the one we have, has,
in fact, been invented seven times across

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.560
different animal species and across time.
So to me these facts argue that vision is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.980
a really important and really effective way
of sensing what is going on in the world around

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.209
you.
Now of course vision needs light in order

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.040
to operate, we need the scene to be illuminated
with ambient light. Photons reflected from

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.069
the scene into our eyes, they fall on the
retina and create some neural stimulus. Absolutely

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.459
has to have a source of light, but of course
we have evolved on a planet next to a really

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.650
bright star. So light is in abundance. It
is a very logical solution to the problem.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.800
We have an abundant source of light and we
have evolved the sensor which has got many

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.040
advantages, but primarily the ability to sense
what is going on at a distance beyond our

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.200
fingertips.
So how did the sense of vision evolve? There

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.560
is a lot of speculation about this, but generally
it is accepted that light sensitive cells

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.150
appeared on the bodies of very primitive life
forms a long time ago, more than 500 million

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.849
years ago, and they have the ability to sense
brightness or light. And perhaps this was

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.830
useful to work out which way was up and which
way was down and maybe you could see the shadow

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.060
of something going across and that was a useful
thing to have. So these photoreceptors could

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.020
sense light and they were connected by some
sort of primitive nerve fibres to some sort

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.060
of primitive brain.
This was clearly a useful idea because over

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.940
time the photoreceptors were arranged into
a curve, or in three dimensions, into a cup.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.160
And this allowed the photoreceptors to respond
to rays that came from a particular direction

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.109
in space. And this was more useful than just
knowing that there was something bright out

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.549
there, now we knew the direction of the bright
thing and this conferred some advantage. This

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.100
design was refined over time, the chamber
became filled with water, perhaps they had

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.400
better optical properties, and then there
was sort of coverings evolved. And then lenses

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.690
evolved. Until we get to something like the
human eye today were we have, you know, protective

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.380
layers, and we have lenses. We have an iris,
which regulates the amount of light which

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.199
falls onto the retinas. So we can operate
quite well in low light and bright light conditions.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.810
The photoreceptors, which are this yellow
layer shown here, are connected by a bunch

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.050
of nerve fibres, the optic nerve, which carry
those stimuli to the optical or visual parts

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.870
of the brain. And that is actually the part
of the brain located at the back of our head.
