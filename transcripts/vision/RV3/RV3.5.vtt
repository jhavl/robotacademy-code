00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.290
Another important monadic image processing
operation is gamma correction, and I am going

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.180
to talk now about the problem of gamma.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.320
Back in the early days of television, the
display device of choice was the cathode ray

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.910
tube and the cathode tube is a very non-linear
device.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.970
So for an input voltage V, the brightness
on the screen, which I am going to call L

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.670
for luminance, was the power of the input
voltage.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.680
In fact, it was almost a square law, so that
is; the luminance of a point on the screen

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.800
was about the square of the input voltage—the
input voltage raised to the power of 2.2.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.700
So this number, 2.2, is referred to as the
gamma of the display device.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340
So this is a bit of a difficulty.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.810
The output luminance is not linearly proportional
to the input voltage.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.280
Now let’s add a camera to the system.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.329
So the camera looks at the world and it sees
luminance L and it converts that to a voltage.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:11.070
The voltage is transmitted to the television
receiver, and the television receiver produces

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.649
a luminance, which is related to the input
voltage raised to the power of gamma.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.229
And what happens now is that our system is
not linear from end to end.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.090
The luminance that I see on my screen is the
original luminance raised to the power of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
gamma, and that is going to have a really
bad effect on contrast.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.780
If one part of the original image is twice
as bright as another on the screen that I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.579
am looking at, it will appear to be almost
four times greater in brightness.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.439
So to get around this problem the early television
engineers pulled a pretty neat trick.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.530
And what they did is they inserted the inversed
non-linearity into the camera: the luminance

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.259
that I see on my TV screen is proportional
to the luminance of the scene that the TV

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.779
camera was looking at.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.610
The system now is linear from end to end.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.880
And that is great for the person viewing the
TV image.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.720
So the process within the camera is referred
to as gamma encoding and the image between

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.709
the camera and the TV screen is referred to
as a gamma encoded image.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.269
And the process of gamma decoding, or sometimes
called gamma correction, happens within the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.769
display screen.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.019
Now where this is relevant today is those
gamma encoded images are what we record in

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.019
image files.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.010
So if I take a standard image file format,
a jpeg file or whatever, the pixel values

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.430
within that file have been gamma encoded.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.190
They are not linearly related to the luminance
of the scene that the camera is looking at.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.640
And in the header of almost any image file
format there is an entry there, which says:

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.000
what’s the gamma setting that has been used
in the camera.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.109
The reason that this is still convenient even
though cathode ray tubes have long gone is

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:09.230
that those image pixels in the image file
are going to be displayed on your screen,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.549
and as I said before even modern screens emulate
the old cathode ray tube non-linearity.

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.090
So it is really important to remember that
the pixel values within an image file are

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.000
not linearly related to the real world luminance.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.390
They are related to that luminance to the
power of 1 over gamma; in fact, it is almost

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.560
a square root function.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.019
So we can do gamma correction, we can treat
that as a monadic function.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.099
The function is basically we take every input
pixel and raise it to the power of gamma.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.709
And we can see that there is basically a parabolic
shape to this mapping.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.819
And if we apply it to an image and look at
it, we see that the image looks very, very

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.019
dark indeed.

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.219
And the reason for that is that what I have
done is gamma corrected this image twice.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:08.359
I have gamma corrected the image by applying
this monadic function and then my screen,

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.500
or your screen, has applied the gamma correction
again.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.280
So it can be useful to apply gamma correction
if you want to look at and manipulate the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.350
pixel values, because you want them to be
proportional to the original light levels

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.440
in the scene, but to display a gamma corrected
image on a monitor is not a useful thing to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.660
do.
