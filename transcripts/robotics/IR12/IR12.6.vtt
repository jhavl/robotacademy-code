00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.110
I talked earlier about the challenges of transportation
as the world population grows. More people,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.299
more cars, more material to support those
people needing to go from where it’s produced

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.740
to where it is consumed.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.040
Motorcars are a wonderful technology. They
have revolutionized the way we live, but they

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.190
are very dangerous machines. Every year, over
one million people are killed by motorcars

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.710
and more than a hundred times that number
are injured.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.210
Globally, this is costing the planet nearly
half a trillion dollars every year. For high-income

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.540
countries, that’s nearly 2% of their gross
national product. In low or middle-income

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.620
countries, that number is smaller, but it’s
growing. And it is a cost of development is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.300
that a larger proportion of your gross national
product is being lost through traffic injuries

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.980
and fatalities. If we look at the 10 leading
causes of death in 2002, road traffic injuries

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.610
were at number 10.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.649
By the year 2030, it’s predicted they will
have grown to number eight. So while we’ve

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.819
done great things for the health of pregnant
women and reduced the incidence of tuberculosis,

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.409
the road traffic injuries, the car is going
to kill more and more people on the planet

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.810
and that’s a sad thing.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.279
Here is some more statistics, which show by
region the percentage of gross national product

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:26.880
that is lost due to traffic injuries and fatalities.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.719
Now, motorcars are driven by human beings
and human beings are the primary cause for

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.219
the motor-vehicle accidents and the fatalities
of 10 million accidents in the United States

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.109
each year. Nine and a half million of those
accidents are due to the fault of the drivers.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.380
I rather like the quote here.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.960
Interestingly, most drivers over estimate
their own ability. I particularly like this quote.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.720
It suggests that most American students, 93% of them believe that they are above average drivers

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.780
and of course, that’s an impossibility.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:07.419
The bottom line is human beings are not very
good drivers even if they believe that they

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:14.970
are. Human beings cause accidents which lead
to a large number of injuries and deaths.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.250
This graph here shows the number of fatalities
per 10 thousand vehicles as a function of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.390
time and we can see that over the last 50
years, there’s been steady improvement in

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.760
reducing the number of fatalities per car
and it’s due to improvements in car design,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.140
campaigns to stop people driving under the
influence of alcohol, the introduction of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.120
seatbelts and airbags and so on. While the
general improvement is quite welcome, the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.050
sad thing is that there is this plateau, the
rate of change of improvement has really fallen

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.560
off and so we’re stuck on this floor. It’s
not at zero. There is this finite number of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.000
accidents that’s going to happen as a fraction
of the number of vehicles on the road.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.260
One consequence of the imperfection of human
drivers is the way that the human-driven cars

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.100
interact with one another. The dynamics of
this system is very, very complex and studied

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.620
by mathematicians and traffic engineers. As
we increase the density of cars on the road,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.440
the flow rate actually starts to fall off and this is a situation that we’ve all experienced personally.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.200
If I look out and down from my office window,
I see a busy expressway and this is a view

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.810
of the expressway when it’s actually quite
congested and not moving particularly quickly.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.970
So the drivers in this situation are thinking
that the traffic is not flowing, that the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.060
road is jammed up, but from my eagle eye view,
I can see that there’s an awful lot of road

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.090
that’s got no cars on it and this is another
problem with human drivers, because they’re

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.900
not very good, they’ve got quite slow reaction
times really, we need to leave large gaps

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.730
in between the cars. It would be much more
efficient if we could pack more cars into

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.709
all of that empty space. Human beings with
a poor reaction times mean that we can’t

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.400
do that. If we did that, we’ll just have
tons more accidents. But perhaps, if human

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.730
beings weren’t driving the cars, if we have
self-driving cars or robotic cars such as

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.000
depicted here by one of the Google self-driving
cars, then perhaps things could be better.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.599
What would be the situation for autonomous
cars that were doing some plateauing. That

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.629
is we have a groups of eight cars travelling
very closely together and moving down the

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:31.080
road, with this sort of technology, we will
be able to fit a lot more cars on the road.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.930
They travel more smoothly. They travel more
quickly. We could get more cars down existing

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.410
roads without having to make them any wider.
