00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.390
We've studied a number of inertial sensors.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.330
The first sensor that we looked at was the
accelerometer and that measures the total

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.509
acceleration of a body.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.590
That acceleration might be due to forces acting
on the body or the acceleration might be due

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.280
to gravity acting on the body.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.020
If the only force acting on a body is gravity,
then we can use the acceleration measured

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.710
on the body to determine the roll and pitch
angles with respect to the gravity vector

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.230
or the downward direction.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.149
We looked at gyroscopes which are able to
measure components of the angular velocity

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.149
of the body.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.100
And, we looked at magnetometers which can
sense components of the Earth’s magnetic

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.589
field with respect to the coordinate frame
attached to the body of the object.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.219
We can combine information from accelerometers
and magnetometers to determine the orientation

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.359
of the body with respect to magnetic north.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.079
The earliest types of inertial navigation
systems were referred to as gimballed and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.949
they are very large instruments that I showed
very early on in this lecture.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.340
It contains a free floating gyro-stabilized
platform referred to as the stable element

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.350
and it’s shown here by the coordinate frame
I.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.310
That platform is connected to the vehicle
by a gimbal mechanism.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.710
As the orientation of the vehicle changes,
the body frame which is attached to the vehicle

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.460
changes, but the inertial coordinate frame
I remains fixed in space.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.039
We can, therefore, determine the orientation
of a vehicle by measuring the angles of the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.079
gimbals between the inertial frame which is
fixed in space and the body frame which is

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.520
attached to the vehicle.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.770
The accelerometers are mounted on the gyro-
stabilized platform, so they measure acceleration

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.060
of the vehicle in the inertial frame.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.080
But if we want to, and we know the orientation
of the vehicle with respect to the inertial

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.420
frame, we can rotate the acceleration vector
in to the vehicles body frame.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.310
This is a schematic of the gimballed inertial
measurement unit used on the Apollo spacecraft.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.810
The stable element is shown here and it contains
three spinning gyroscopes and they maintain

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.690
the orientation of that platform constant
with respect to the stars.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.709
That platform also contains three accelerometers
indicated here, XA, YA and ZA.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.760
The gimbal mechanism effectively allows the
spacecraft to rotate about the stable platform

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.980
and the gimbal angles are measured by rather
old fashioned sensors by today’s standard

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.410
called resolvers.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.090
Today, almost all inertial measurement units
use what’s called the strap-down configuration.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.510
We have a body frame B attached to the vehicle
and the accelerometers and gyroscopes measure

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.769
acceleration along each of the body frame
axis and the gyroscopes measure the angular

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.099
velocity components about each of the body
frame coordinate axes.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.290
As the vehicle orientation changes, so does
the body frame B, we measure the angular velocity

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.060
in the coordinate frame B and we integrate
that over time to determine the orientation

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.549
of the vehicle.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.180
Once we know the orientation of the vehicle
in the body frame, we can rotate it back to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.719
the inertial frame to determine our acceleration
with respect to the stars.
