00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.019
If you ask people today to say what a robot
looks like, they're either going to tell you

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.450
about a fictional robot, like R2D2 or they're
going to mention a manufacturing robot such

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.090
as the one shown here and there are many many
of these robots at work on the planet today,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.460
more than 1 million of them and they underpin
a lot of modern manufacturing, of automobiles,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.400
of electronic devices, like computers.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.000
They also do a lot of material handling, moving
boxes off conveyor belts and putting them

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.510
in shipping cartons, even picking up shipping
cartons and putting them onto pallets and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.350
so on. Robots such as this represent the first
generation of robots. They are really direct

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.950
descendants of the robots created by Unimation
Inc. that we talked about in the last section.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.300
Here's an example of a modern manufacturing
robot at work. This is a video that I took

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.090
at a robot exhibition last year. And what
we can see is the robot is moving and picking

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.780
up a piece from the bucket at the bottom of
the ramp, and you can see that the pieces

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.909
are all in different orientations and the
robot has got some sensors so that it can determine

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.929
the orientation of its gripper that it needs
to adopt in order to pick-up the object, and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.509
once it has done that, moves it to the top
of the ramp and lets it go. This robot is

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.020
performing an endless loop of pick up the
thing from location A and drop it at location B.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.439
Another type of robot is this. This is the
robot vacuum cleaner and this is a technology

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.319
that was introduced around 2004 and since
that time they became enormously popular,

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.520
more than 10 million of them have been sold.
So the manufacturing robot that we saw a moment

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.409
ago is a technology that's nearly 60 years
old and thereâ€™s a million of them at work. This

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.060
technology which is only just over a decade
old has sold more than 10 million of them.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.950
One of the reasons these robots are so popular
is they perform a very useful task, a task

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.200
that human beings don't like doing so much,
and they do it for a very low price. The reason

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.559
that they're able to build a robot for such
a low cost is it has got really limited computational

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:13.719
capability and robots are able to clean the
floor by adopting a very very simple strategy.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.659
The robot doesn't actually know where it is.
What it does is just drives in a straight

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.459
line, sucking up dirt until it hits an obstacle
and bounces off the obstacle and then goes

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.549
in a different direction.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.030
So this time lapse picture here, shows the
path of a Roomba robot cleaning a living room

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.170
and we can see where it's bounced off the
walls and off the furniture. By adopting this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.450
very simple strategy, we can cover the whole
room. It's clear though, that some parts of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.590
the room are covered many many times and some
parts of the room are covered not very often

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.489
at all.
We can imagine scaling up a technology like

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.019
that vacuum cleaner to a robot system that's
able to pick up and put down containers in

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.239
a shipping port, and in fact people have built
remote systems to do this.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.299
So these robots pick up a container at location
A and transport it to location B, when they

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.579
put it down again. Robots that move materials
from location A to location B, inside manufacturing

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.430
plants are now really quite common, and this
separates them from the first generation of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.700
robots. The manufacturing robots which are
fixed at a single place in the world, the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.909
next generation of robots are able to move
within the environment.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.459
Here we see a research robot called little
dog, and it played a really important role

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.749
in research into how we plan where robots
place their feet in order to walk competently

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.980
over very rough and uneven terrain.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.370
Here we see the big brother of little dog,
logically called big dog, and this is a robot

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.620
that's able to carry quite a large payload
over very rough terrain in realistic outdoor

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.400
environments. Here we see a demonstration
of the stability of this robot walking over

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.440
ice and being kicked in the side and able
to recover its balance and keep on walking.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.980
Once again we can see a wonderful demonstration of its ability to recover from very very difficult situations.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.139
In addition to wheels and legs, robots can
also fly and people have demonstrated very

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.060
large scale flying robots like the Global
Hawk here on the left and really, really small

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.840
flying robots are shown here on the right.
So what's the definition of a robot? A definition

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.240
that I like a lot and I think is actually
very very useful, even though it's perhaps

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.250
a little simple is it's a machine that moves
things from A to B. Now, it's a programmable

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.250
machine so we can control the location A and
the location B and perhaps the location A

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.900
is a function of information that the robot
picks up from its sensors. But in the simplest

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.470
case, a robot is a machine that moves things
from A to B.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.389
From mobile robots such as those that have
got wheels or legs or propellers and can fly,

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.020
we can think of it as a machine that moves
automatically from location A to location

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.289
B. A high level, a more complex definition
of a robot that I like is it is a goal-oriented

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.449
machine that can sense, plan and act, and
this phrase catches, I think the four really

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.860
key elements of a robot.
The first thing is, it's a machine that has

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.509
a goal. There's something that it wants to
achieve, it wants to deliver itself from one

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.590
place to another or it wants to move something
from one place to another, so that is its

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.560
goal.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.500
In the example of the manufacturing robot,
we saw that it was able to sense where are

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.090
the white objects that it wanted to pick-up.
We saw with a little dog walking robot, it

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.030
was able to sense the shape of its environment
in order to determine where its feet should

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.080
go and that brings us then to the next part,
that is to plan. So once the robot has sensed

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.590
where it is and sensed something about the
environment in which it's moving, then it

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.849
makes a plan to bring the robot closer to
its goal and once it's created a plan in order

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.270
to move closer to its goal, then it acts.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.560
It moves the wheels, it moves the legs, it
changes the speed on the propellers, in order

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.310
for the robot to get closer towards the goal.
And it repeats these three actions continuously.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.289
It senses, it plans, it acts. It senses the
state of the world again and it updates its

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.800
plan and then it acts a bit more and so on
until it reaches the goal. What are the characteristics

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.110
of robots? Why are robots useful to us? Well,
they have a number of merits. First of all

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.860
robots are very consistent, they pay attention
all the time, unlike human beings.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.750
Robots are also very accurate. The manufacturing
robots that we saw earlier are able to position

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.849
the end of the robot to an accuracy of a fraction
of a millimeter, every single time they perform

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.569
the operation and they're also very, very
reliable. They can work 24 by 7. They don't

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.039
even need the lights on in order to do their
job. So this means that robots are able to

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.289
do a number of things that people can't do.
They can go into space, they can go deep into

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:22.039
the oceans where human beings are just not
able to survive. They also do things that

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.189
human beings won't do. These are jobs that
are boring or dull.

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:32.319
And increasingly there are a lot of low-skill
jobs in agriculture and in manufacturing where

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:37.250
it's very difficult to find human beings willing
to do that work. These are jobs human beings

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.280
now consider are beneath them and won't do.
Now robots are going to move into that job

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.360
vacuum. And finally, robots do things that
people shouldn't do. They can perform jobs

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.530
that are dangerous, unhealthy or risky, that
is, the robots take people out of harm's way

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.169
and I think that's a very great thing that
robots can do.

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:03.069
People often use the expression, 'dirty, dull
and dangerous' to reflect the three classes

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:08.669
of jobs where robots have considerable advantage
over human beings. The dirty and dangerous

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:13.000
jobs are the ones that human beings shouldn't
do and the dull jobs are the ones that human

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:14.529
beings don't want to do.
