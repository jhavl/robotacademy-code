00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.780
The next part of the process is reflectance.
That is where the incoming illuminance reflects

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.219
off an object. We are very familiar with the
ability of shiny surfaces or mirrors to reflect

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.810
light.
In high school physics we learn about the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.840
rules of reflection from such a surface, where
the angle of incidence equals the angle of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.840
reflection and we refer to this as specular
reflection. Now this is not saying anything

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.730
about the color change that occurs during
reflection, it is simply talking about the

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.250
geometry of the reflection process.
We refer to this as specular reflection, which

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.480
is related to the Latin word for mirror. We
met William Herschel before, who is the guy

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.579
who discovered infra-red radiation and he
made the big mirror in his telescope from

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.600
a type of metal that was called speculum metal—it
was reflective alloy of copper and tin and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.980
it was used in the old days for making telescope
mirrors.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.790
A more realistic model for the way light is
reflected off objects is what is called Lambertian

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.210
reflection, and Lambertian reflection differs
from specular reflection in that the incoming

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.759
light is reflected off in all manner of directions.
This is the sort of reflection that occurs

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:21.749
from a dull or matt surface. Sometimes called
diffuse reflection and it is named after Johann

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:28.369
Lambert, who was a physicist in the 1700s.
The intensity of the light that is reflected

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.729
from the surface is related to the angle of
reflection, and what is interesting with Lambertian

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.840
reflection is that it leads to the brightness
being invariant to the observer’s angle

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.959
of view.
Now the moon is a really good example of Lambertian

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:50.329
reflection. We know that the moon is a sphere,
but when we look at it, it appears to be a

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.409
fairly uniformly bright disk, apart from the
craters and the seas. So the reason that it

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.889
appears is to be uniformly bright even though
the light has been reflected, is proportioned

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:07.179
to the cos sign of the angle, is that the
area of the region that we are looking at

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.760
appears to change in size. Here is an exaggerated
example: I take this particular patch of the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.599
moon and most of the light from that patch
is being reflected directly up, it corresponds

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.060
to an array something like this. If I take
a patch that is down near the pole it is clearly

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.870
going to be inclined with respect to my field
of view. So it is going to have one of these

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.980
rays down here associated, so it is going
to be reflecting less light, but the area—the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.500
apparent area of this patch—is smaller because
I am looking at it obliquely. So if I consider

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.250
the brightness to be the ratio of the light
being omitted to its surface area, this is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.379
invariant to the view angle.
So we have just looked at the geometry of

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.500
the reflection, the direction of the rays
being reflected form the surface as a function

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.900
of the incoming ray. Let’s talk now about
how reflection changes the color of incoming

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.969
light. Here we see a red house brick, the
plot here shows what we call the reflectance

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.010
of the house brick; that is, the fraction
of light that is reflected form the brick

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.920
as a function of wavelength. And it is quite
a complex curve, we see that there are some

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.060
parts of the spectrum where it reflects a
large amount of light and there are other

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.659
parts of the spectrum where it reflects very
little light.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.420
The right hand graph shows a zoom into the
visible part of the spectrum.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.939
Now we can see that the red brick reflects
not very much blue light in the region, say

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.349
400 to 500 nanometers, but it does reflect
a fair amount of the red light that is falling

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.200
down, say the light between 600 and 700 nanometers,
and that is why it looks red to us, it reflects

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.829
more red light then it reflects blue light.
So this is the spectrum of a red brick, different

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.799
minerals have different reflectance spectrums
and here we see the reflectance spectrum for

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.719
a number of minerals. If we have an instrument
that can measure the reflectance at a number

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.870
of different wavelengths, an instrument perhaps
like a spectrometer or a hyper spectral camera,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.889
then we can measure one of these particular
curves and we can match it against a library

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.939
of known minerals and use it to identify what
minerals are within the scene.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.530
So to recap, incoming light, we refer to as
the luminance and it has got a spectrum E,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.410
which has got a function of the wavelength
lambda, and we have the reflectance of the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.890
object itself which we refer to as R and it
is also a function of lambda.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.870
So the light that leaves the apple, which
we refer to as the illuminance of the apple,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.730
I am going to use the symbol L and it is also
a function of the wavelength, now L at any

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.350
particular lambda is equal to E
at that same lambda multiplied by R at that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.260
particular lambda. That is the spectrum of
the light that is leaving the apple, the function

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.520
of the spectrum of the incoming light, and
the function of the reflectance of the apple.
