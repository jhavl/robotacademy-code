00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.570
There is no way we can throw away something
as important as a dimension without there

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.750
being some consequences and there are some
quite significant consequences, but we tend

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.980
not to think about them.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.640
If I look at this scene of parallel railway
lines, they clearly appear to converge and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.500
we expect that. Looking at this scene we know
that they are parallel lines and this comes

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.859
from our everyday experience with what a three dimensional world looks like, but it’s kind of surprising

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.520
that things that are parallel in the world
appear to us to be converging and we don’t

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.340
give it any thought at all. It is unsurprising
to us.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.210
Here is another example, looking up at a bunch
of trees and they appear to be converging

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.559
even though these trees are all parallel to
one another, emerging vertically from the

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.969
ground plain.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.820
Here is another example of the ferris wheel
and we know that the ferris wheel is round.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.660
Now in this particular image, because I have
looked at it obliquely, it clearly appears

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.739
to be elliptical.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.420
So what’s going on here? Well, mathematically
the perspective projection maps lines to lines,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.909
but it doesn't preserve angles. That means that parallel lines in the world will not necessarily

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.540
appear to be parallel in an image. There are
cases when there will be, but in general,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.750
parallel lines do not remain parallel after
the projection.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.950
The other shape mapping perceptive projection
does, is it maps conics to conics. So a conic,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.240
short for conic section is the shape that
you get by slicing through a solid cone and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.439
though shapes can be a circle, an ellipse,
a parabola or a hyperbola.
