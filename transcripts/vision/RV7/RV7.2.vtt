00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Let’s talk about the geometry of how images
are formed. All images start with light coming

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.599
from some source of illumination; perhaps
the sun, perhaps indoor lights in the ceiling

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.180
of a building and that light reflects off
objects in the world. Some of that reflected

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.269
light ends up in our eyes. There are two types
of reflection. There is the mirror-like reflection

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.199
we call specular reflection and there is the
reflection from a diffuse or matte surface,

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.230
which is called Lambertian reflection.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.550
Most surfaces are a mixture of specular reflection
and Lambertion reflection. But irrespective

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
of the sort of reflection that’s occurring,
we have light from a light source reflecting

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.969
off objects and some of those light rays are
going to enter our eyes. Let’s look at this

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.020
in a graphical representation.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.730
Once again, we have our observer of the scene.
We have a three-dimensional object in the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.480
world and we’re going to consider what happens
at just a few points on that particular object.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.269
So the first thing we need is a source of
light.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.500
We turn on the sun and what’s going to happen
now is light is going to be reflected from

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.470
the sun at a number of these points and some
of those light rays are going to enter the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.700
eyes of the observer.
When we look at a three-dimensional statue

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.299
like this either through a camera or with
our own eyes, we experience a very vivid and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.270
crisp image of that object. But if I simply
hold up a piece of paper here and it is receiving

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.970
light that’s reflected off the statue, then
no matter how hard or how closely I look at

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.049
this paper, there is no concept of image being
formed on here. We need to organize the light

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.240
rays, which are leaving the statue in order
to get a crisp image.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.770
So let’s look at this problem graphically.
We have an image plane, the piece of paper

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.829
that I just held up and if I consider any
particular point on that image plane, the

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.659
light that’s falling on any single point
could have come from any number of points

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.250
on the three-dimensional object. What’s
happened is the light from all of those points

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.599
is being mixed up so that if I just hold up
a piece of paper no coherent image will be

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.900
formed on that.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.810
What we need to do is to order the light rays
in some way and the simplest way to think

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.370
about doing this is to put an opaque plane
in front of the image plane and to drill a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.349
small hole in it. This is a configuration
that’s referred to as a pinhole camera.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.390
What this does is order the rays that are
leaving the points on the object and it causes

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.290
an inverted (that is an upside-down image)
to be formed on the image plane. This approach

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.930
to imaging is called a pinhole camera. Sometimes
it’s called a camera obscura and it’s

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.450
been known since ancient times.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.349
This picture shows a building with a small
hole drilled in its wall and what’s happening

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.080
is that there is an image of the bright sun
outside is being cast on the interior wall

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.550
of the building.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.470
Here are some examples of pinhole camera images
that I’ve downloaded from the web. People

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.239
have observed these images perhaps they’ve
been inside a darkened room, there’s been

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.360
a bright scene outside, a bright sunny day
and there’s been perhaps a hole on the blind

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.879
or window covering and that has caused an
image of the outside world to be cast on the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:17.879
wall.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.282
Now recall from the previous example that
this image is inverted. So in the left-hand

00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:22.282
image, the person like turned their camera
upside-down and you can see an electric toothbrush

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:23.282
hanging from the top and in the right-hand
image, you can see the fact that the pinhole

00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:26.010
image is in fact inverted. Here is an example
of a very, very large pinhole camera. This

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.409
was an amazing project that happened in a
disused aircraft hangar back in 2008. On the

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.590
left, we can see a bunch of people standing
in front of the image plane. That’s where

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.730
the image from the pinhole camera has been
cast and on the right-hand side, you can see

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.400
them endeavouring to actually capture that
image so they made a very, very large piece

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.540
of film, a very large negative and they’re
going to put it up against the wall and expose

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.939
it and capture an image using this pinhole
camera.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.860
So, a quick refresher on what happens with
a pinhole camera. Rays of light leave various

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.530
points on the object. They all pass through
the pinhole and cast an upside-down image

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.180
on what we call the image plane.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.549
The geometry of this pinhole camera is actually
very simple to describe. We’ll consider

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.850
that the object is at a distance Z away from
the plane of the pinhole and the image plane

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.040
is a distance F (F for focal distance) away
from the plane of the pinhole.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.270
Then if the height of the object is Y, the
height of the image is y and these are two

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.350
similar triangles. So it’s very easy to
write the relationship over here. It simply

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.139
comes from the fact that we’ve got two similar
triangles. We can also do the same thing for

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.030
the horizontal plane. We introduce the symbol
X for the distance out of the page of the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.759
object that we’re looking at and x for the
distance along the wall in the image plane.

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:03.440
We can again write the equations that come
from looking at two similar triangles. So

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.800
this image formation process maps a point
in the world with coordinates X, Y and Z to

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.940
a point on the image plane whose coordinates
are x and y. We can rearrange those equations

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.970
in this fashion.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:28.410
So if x now in terms of the real world coordinates
X and Z and similarly for y. So this is what

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.660
we call a projection. It projects a three-dimensional
quantity X, Y, Z into a two-dimensional quantity,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.610
x and y. It is a mapping between three dimensions
and two dimensions.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.860
This referred to as perspective projection.
This is the mathematical basis for the process

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.250
that we’d call perspective projection. A
consequence of perspective projection is that

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:02.610
there is no unique inverse. If I have an image
of the object in the real world then there

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.360
are an infinite number of possible objects
that could cause that image. It could be a

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.340
small object that’s close to me or it could
be a large object that’s further away from

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.340
me.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.810
One of the dimensions has been fundamentally
lost. From a two-dimensional image, we cannot

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.020
recover this third dimension. Now, in our
brains, we use a lot of tricks to try and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.789
recover that third dimension.
We know something about the structure of the

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.039
world. We know something about the size of
objects. So if we see what looks like a small

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.729
person we think “No, no, no, it’s probably
a large person who is further away.”

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.030
So to recover the third dimension is fundamentally
impossible but there is other information

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.400
that we can bring to bear to recover it.
