00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.900
In previous lectures we talked about kinematics
and in particular we talked about forward

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.919
kinematics. And that's the problem of given
the joint angles of the robot. One is the

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.110
pose of the robots end effector. We then moved
on and we talked about inverse kinematic which

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.350
is the problem given the end effector pose,
what are the joint angles needed to achieve that?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
In this lecture we are going to be talking
about velocities. We're interested in the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.660
relationship between the velocity of the joint
angles and the velocity of the end effector.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.079
We're interested in the derivative of the
end effector pose.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.489
And one of the topics we're going to discuss
is what exactly does it mean to take the derivative

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.620
of the pose of the end effector of a robot.
We're going to start our discussion simply

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.960
and consider robots that operate only in the
plane. And in the next lecture we are going

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.789
to talk about this for robots that move within
three dimensions.
