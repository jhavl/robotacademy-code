00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.510
In this section I'd like to talk about robots
and jobs. Whenever I go and give a public

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.869
talk about robotics, somebody in the audience
always ask me about robots and jobs. Arnâ€™t

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.770
robots going to take jobs away from people?
And it's true, robots will take jobs away

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.420
from people. But there are jobs that I believe
people shouldn't do. And that's because those

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.240
jobs are dangerous.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.140
So if we look at the data shown here, we look
at the number of fatalities per a 100,000

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.510
workers in a number of different occupational
areas recorded at 2 points in time. And we

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.890
can see that there are some industries, which
are really quite dangerous. People can go

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.489
to work in one of these industries and not
come home at night because they've been killed

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.319
on the job. And to me that's non-acceptable.
If there are dangerous jobs, then it should

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.979
be machines doing work instead of humans.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.249
I'm going to focus a bit on the mining industry
because that's an area where I spent more

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:03.019
than 10 years developing various robotic technologies
for underground and surface mining.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.500
Let's first of all look at some fatality data
from the United States mining industry compiled

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.409
over a period of about 100 years.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.320
The line graph show the fatality rate normalized
to production. Then we see a very happy reduction

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.950
in that fatality rate. The black line is for
the coal industry and the red line is for

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.880
non-coal industry which is generally service
mining operations. They tend to be safer than

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.229
underground coal mining.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.990
So while there has been a very considerable
improvement over time. We observe just as

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.200
we did for road accident fatalities that the
rate of improvement is plateauing and it's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.770
not plateauing to zero. It's plateauing to
a value above zero. So there is some residual

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.979
rate of fatality that will occur in mining
operations.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.049
Despite 100 years of continuous improvement,
we are really struggling to get this rate

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.340
down to zero. If we look at the types of accidents
that occur in mines today, we see that the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.009
courses are really quite varied. Some of them
are unfortunate encounters between human beings

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.340
and machines, conveyer belts and trucks and
so on. Some of them are electrocutions, people

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.940
slipping and falling, relatively few of them
involved people being killed by falling rocks,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.600
which is perhaps what most people would consider
to be leading cause of death in an underground mine.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.280
So what can we do about this? Well the important
thing is to remove the human beings from hazardous

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.520
situations. Here is a type of vehicle called
a load haul dump unit or a scoop tram if you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.000
come from Canada. And it's used to carry ore
in an underground mine. Now once upon a time

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.310
these machines were all driven by a driver
who sat here. The problem is that these machines

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.800
go in to dangerous parts of the mine. So what
some mining companies do now is to remove

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.450
the operator to a safe remote location.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.800
Here the operator is able to control the machine
with the joystick and she can see the status

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.010
of the machine through a view of the camera
and the position of the vehicle superimpose

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.440
on a map of the mine. And that situational
awareness information is coming from various

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.130
senses fitted to the machine.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.900
So what we're seeing now is a separation between
the person doing the work and the place where

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.400
the work is occurring. And this happens in
many other situations as well. An underwater

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.290
vehicle which is doing some task deep beneath
the ocean. The operator is at some comfortable

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.250
workstation on board a ship. Consider the
case of a Mars robot. It's doing the work

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.410
of geologist and chemist on the surface of
Mars whereas the actual geologist and chemist

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.090
are sitting at workstations on earth.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.370
Consider the case of robotic surgery that
we look at earlier. The surgeons are doing

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.570
their work at workstations on the left hand
side of the picture where the actual work,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.070
the actual surgery is occurring inside of
the body of the patient. And that's being

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.010
done by the robots here. Now the robots are
connected to the workstations by cables. So

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.630
there's no reason in fact that those cables
couldn't be longer. They could in fact be

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.270
an intercontinental telecommunications link.
And this is actually being demonstrated. We've

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.650
had surgeons on one continent performing an
operation on a patient in another continent.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.120
So the worker and the place of work are now
quite distinct.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.620
So traditionally, the work has been at the
workplace. The worker has been on the machine

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.440
or controlling the machine directly. Right
now with remote control technology, it's possible

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.060
that the worker can be remote from the machine.
But in the future I think what's going to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.620
happen is that the machine will be smarter and they'll be able to a lot of the work all by themselves.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.080
So we will move to a situation where one worker
will be remotely managing many machines. That

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.220
means that the worker who is not joy sticking
the machine in the traditional sense they

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.620
giving a high level command to the machine.
They are saying machine A go off and do this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.680
task. Machine B go off and do this task. Machine
C go and do this task. And if one of the machines

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.030
has encountered a problem then it would come
back to the operator.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.490
Machine B may come back to the operator and
say, "I don't know how to do this thing that

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.070
you've asked me to do." So the operator can
give machine B some more detailed instructions.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.420
So it's like the way a human manager manages
a number of human workers. But now we have

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.970
a human manager managing a number of intelligent
machines.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.150
Perhaps sometime in the medium future, the
machines will be smart enough not to need

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.460
human managers. But right now we need a combination of human intuition, intelligence and experience

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.920
combined with the relentless work ethic, the
tirelessness and the reliability of robotic workers.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.530
So in the future I believe work will be a
partnership between human managers and robot

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.690
workers. And what this enables is the same
or greater level of productivity perhaps with

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.570
lower operator skill levels. Because the skill
is going to be encapsulated in the robot worker.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.740
The robot worker is going to do the detailed
skilful work and the human manager is going

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.419
to tell the robot where it should be deploying
its particular skill.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.669
Machines are going to suffer much less damage
because they're going to be driven by computers

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.630
rather than by human beings. The computers
are going to ensure that the machines are

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.000
driven safely and within their operational
envelopes.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.270
And finally we'll be able to achieve force
multiplication. That means that more work

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.290
will be able to be done by fewer people because
they're going to be assisted by robots.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.940
In order to achieve this, we're going to need
high communications bandwidth between where

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.810
the robots are doing their work and where
the human managers are sitting at their workstations.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.590
We're going to need the machines to have some level of local autonomy, some level of local automation.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.300
We're going to have to take a system's approach
to the way we do task; where do we situate

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.210
the people, where do we situate the robot,
how much intelligence should we embed in the

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.340
robot, how much communications do we need.
So it's going to be a new way of thinking

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.730
about work places and how humans and robots
interact.
