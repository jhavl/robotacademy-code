00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.769
We saw this simple two-link robot in the previous
lecture about forward kinematics.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.700
The tooltip pose of this robot is described
simply by two numbers, the coordinates x and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550
y with respect to the world coordinate frame.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.010
So, the problem here is that given x and y,
we want to determine the joined angles, Q1

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.150
and Q2.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.890
The solution that we’re going to follow
in this particular section is a geometric

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.890
one.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.660
We’re going to start with a simple piece
of construction.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.580
We’re going to overlay the red triangle
on top of our robot.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.730
We know that the end point coordinate is x,
y, so the vertical height of the triangle

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.250
is y, the horizontal width is x.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.800
And, using Pythagoras theorem, we can write
r squared equals x squared plus y squared.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.399
So far, so easy.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.660
Now, we’re going to look at this triangle
highlighted here in red and we want to determine

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.680
the angle alpha.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.230
In order to do that, we need to use the cosine
rule.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.970
And, if you’re a little rusty on the cosine
rule, here is a bit of a refresher.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.649
We have an arbitrary triangle.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.540
We don’t have to have any right angles in
it and we’re going to label the length of

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.180
this edge as A and the angle opposite that
edge, we’re going to label as little a.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.000
And, we do the same for this edge and this
angle, and this edge and this angle.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.030
So, all together, the sides are labelled capitals
A, B and C, and the angles are labelled little

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.280
a, little b, and little c.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.010
So, the cosine rule is simply this relationship
here.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.640
It’s a bit like Pythagoras’ theorem except
for this extra term on the end with the cos

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.729
a in it.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.250
Now, let’s apply the cosine rule to the
particular triangle we looked at a moment

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.250
ago.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.689
It’s pretty straightforward to write down
this particular relationship.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.020
We can isolate the term cos alpha which gives
us the angle alpha that we’re interested

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.020
in.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.450
And, it’s defined in terms of the constant
link lengths, A1 and A2 and the position of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.329
the end effector, x and y.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.579
We can write this simple relationship between
the angles alpha and Q2.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.500
And, we know from the shape of the cosine
function that cos of Q2 must be equal to negative

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.510
of cos alpha.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.240
This time, let’s just write an expression
for the cosine of the joined angle Q2.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.750
Now, we’re going to draw yet another red
triangle and we’re going apply some simple

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.250
trigonometry here.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.270
If we know Q2, then we know this length and
this length of the red triangle.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.970
We can write this relationship for the sine
of the joined angle Q2.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.700
Now, we can consider this bigger triangle
whose angle is beta and this side length of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.820
the triangle is given here in blue.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.070
And, the length of the other side of the triangle
is this.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.560
So, now we can write an expression for the
angle beta in terms of these parameters here.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.260
Going back to the red triangle that we drew
earlier, we can establish a relationship between

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.050
Q1 and the angle beta.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.790
Introduce yet another angle, this one gamma
and we can write a relationship between the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.669
angle gamma and the tooltip coordinates x
and y.

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.910
Now, we can write a simple relationship between
the angles that we’ve constructed, gamma

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.400
and beta and the joined angle we’re interested
in which is Q1.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.680
And, the total relationship looks something
like this.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.180
Quite a complex relationship, it gives us
the angle of joined one, that’s Q1 in terms

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.260
of the end effector coordinates y and x, and
a bunch of constants, a1 and a2, and it’s

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.480
also a function of the second joint angle,
Q2.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.870
So, let’s summarize what it is that we have
derived here.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.750
We have an expression for the cosine of Q2
and we have an expression for Q1.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.690
Now, the cosine function is symmetrical about
0.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.030
So, if we know the value of the cosine of
Q2, then there are two possible solutions,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.180
a positive angle and a negative angle.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.780
We’re going to explicitly choose the positive
angle, which means that I can write this expression

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.780
here.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.880
And now, we have what we call the inverse
kinematic solution for this two-link robot.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.040
We have an expression for the two joined angles,
Q1 and Q2 in terms of the end effector pose

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.120
x and y, and a bunch of constants.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.510
You notice that the two equations are not
independent.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.540
The equation for Q1, in fact, depends on the
solution for Q2.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.940
In this case, Q2 is negative and we’re going
to write the solution for Q2 with a negative

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.440
sign in front of the inverse cosine.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.310
Now, we need to solve for Q1, so we’re going
to introduce this particular red triangle,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.250
the angle beta that we solved previously,
and the angle gamma which is defined in terms

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.440
of y and x.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.470
Now, we write a slightly different relationship
between Q1, gamma and beta, different to what

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.470
we had before.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.780
There’s a change of sign involved.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.180
Then, we can substitute all that previous
equation and come up with this expression

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.180
for Q1.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.400
Again, there is a change of sign here.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.430
Previously, this was a negative sign.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.470
And, here in summary form is the solution
for the inverse kinematics of our two-link

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.480
robot when it is in this particular configuration,
where Q2 is negative.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.070
Let’s compare the two solutions, the case
where Q2 is positive and the case where Q2

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.820
is negative.
