00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.970
Here we have the same two link robot as we
just looked at but this time we're going to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.639
solve it using an analytical approach, that
is we're going to rely much more on algebra,

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.220
particular linear algebra rather than geometry.
We have an expression E, which is the homogeneous

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.460
transformation which represents the pose of
the robots endefector and we looked at this

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.500
in the last lecture, we can write the endefector
pose as a sequence of elementary homogeneous

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.809
transformations. A rotation by Q1, a translation
along the X direction by A1, a rotation by

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.859
Q2 and then a translation in the X direction
by A2. If I expand this out, multiply all

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.870
the transformations together, I get the expression
shown here; a three by three homogeneous transformation

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.069
matrix representing the pose of the robot's
endefector.

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.949
Now for this particular two link robot, we
are only interested in the position of its

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.159
endefector, it's X and Y co-ordinate and they
are these two elements within the homogeneous

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.780
transformation matrix, so I'm going to copy
those out. So here again is our expression

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.990
for X and Y and what we're going to do is
a fairly common trick, we're going to square

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.610
and add these two equations and I get a relationship
that looks like this. Now I can solve for

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.750
the joint angle Q2 in terms of the endefector
pose X and Y and the robot's constants A1 and A2.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.140
Now what I'm going to do is apply the sum
of angles identity. I'm going to expand these

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.289
terms, sine of Q1 plus Q2 or cos of Q1 plus
Q2 and to make life a little bit easier, I'm

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.409
going to make some substations, so where ever
I had cos Q2, I'm going to write C2 and where

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.240
ever I had sine Q2, Iâ€™m going to write S2.
It's a fairly common shorthand when people

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.969
are looking at robot kinematic equations.
And here are the equations after making those

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.119
substitutions. Looking at these two equations,
I can see that they fall into a very well

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.280
known form and for that form there is a very
well known solution. So I'm going to consider

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.930
just one of the equations, the equation for
Y and using our well known identity and it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.870
solution, I can determine the values for the
variables little a, little b and little c

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.390
and once I've determined those, then I can
just write down the solution for Q1, which

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.209
is the equivalent of theta in this particular
case.

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.530
Here again is our expression for Q1, copied
over from the previous slide and we may remember

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.799
from earlier in our workings that we determined
this particular relationship; X squared plus

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.390
Y squared is equal to this particular complex
expression. So I can substitute that in and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.830
do some simplification and I end up with this
slightly less complex expression for Q1. And

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.760
it is the same expression that I got following
the geometric approach in the previous section.
