00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.050
In previous lectures, we talked a lot about
the position and orientation of objects in

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.210
the world. In this lecture, we're going to
talk about the rate of change of position

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.170
and the rate of change of orientation. We're
going talk about velocities.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.029
In this picture, we can see a ball moving
through the air. Before we can say anything

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.730
meaningful about the velocity or position
of the ball, we need to introduce a reference

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
coordinate frame. By now this is a familiar
concept to us.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.040
Now I can talk about the velocity of the ball
and I describe that by this blue vector which

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.060
I've labeled V. So V is the velocity vector
and that describes the direction and the magnitude

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.320
of the motion or the rate of change of position
of the ball at this particular moment in time.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.840
The moment when this photograph was taken.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.670
Now velocity is a vector quantity. It's got
3 components defined with respect to the coordinate

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.180
frame and that is the rate of change of the
X coordinate, that's x dot. The rate of change

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.409
of the Y coordinate and the rate of change
of the Z coordinate.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.630
Now we can consider the rather more complex
motion of a Frisbee flying through the air

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.859
and once again before we can say anything
meaningful about the position or velocity

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.520
of this object, we need to define a reference
coordinate frame. Now the Frisbee has got

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.380
a translational of velocity. It's moving through
the air from the person who threw it to the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.689
place where its going to land but the Frisbee
also spins and we say the Frisbee has got

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.469
an angular velocity and that's denoted
here by the red vector that I've called omega.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.369
Once again the translational velocity V
and the angular velocity omega change continually

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.049
as the object is moving. So these vectors
represent translational and angular velocity

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.009
at the instant that this picture was taken.
The angular velocity, that's the red vector

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.999
here, has got a direction and that is the
axis about which the body is rotating at this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.599
particular instant in time and the magnitude
of this vector is the rate of rotation around

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.960
that axis. If the object was spinning very
quickly, then the angular velocity vector

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.860
would be very long. Once again, the angular
velocity vector has got 3 components so we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.000
can take this red vector and we can describe
components with respect to the X, Y, and Z

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.660
axis of a reference coordinate frame.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.840
Now it's not just Frisbee and balls that have
got translational and rotational velocity.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.210
The end effector of a robot arm has a translational
velocity and an angular velocity and often

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.060
we need to specify what these are and in fact
command the robot joints so that we get the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.980
desired translational and angular velocity
of the robotâ€™s end effector.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.420
Typically we stack the elements of the translational
velocity, the elements VX, VY and VZ and the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.130
elements of the angular velocity, omega x,
omega y and omega z into one vector.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.640
That's six elements long and we refer to this
as the spatial velocity or the twist of the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.270
object. We use the greek letter nu which looks
a bit like a V to denote this special quantity,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.510
this spatial velocity or twist which has got
6 elements. It's a six element vector.
