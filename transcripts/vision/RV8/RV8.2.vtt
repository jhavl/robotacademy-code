00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.750
Image formation

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.769
Now, we're going to look at a more mathematical
way to describe the projection process, projection

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.420
of a point from the real world into the image
plane. In the last lecture, we looked at it

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.460
from a very intuitive and geometric perspective.
This time, we're going to look at it more

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.990
mathematically.
We're going to use a different projection

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.430
model to what we used last time. We're going
to use a model that's referred to as the "central

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.970
projection" model. The key elements of this
model are the cameras co-ordinate frame we

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.149
denote by C. The image plane is parallel to
the camera's x and y axis and positioned at

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.800
a distance F in the positive z direction.
F is equivalent to the focal length of the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.510
lens that we talked about in the last lecture.
Now in order to project the point, what we

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.930
do is we cast a ray from the point in the
world through the image plane to the origin

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.100
of the camera. With the central projection
model, you'll note that the image is non-inverted

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.020
as it was in the case that we talked about
in the last lecture. We can write an equation

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.869
for the point P in homogeneous coordinates,
we multiply the world coordinates, X, Y, Z

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.360
by a 3 x 4 matrix in order to get the homogeneous
coordinates of the projected point on the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.439
image plane.
Let's look at this equation in a little bit

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.729
more detail. It's quite straightforward to
write an expression for x̃, ỹ, z̃ in terms

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.670
of the focal length and the world coordinate,
X, Y, Z. We can transform the homogeneous

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.650
coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using
the rule that we talked about in the last

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.079
section and with a little bit of rearrangement,
we can bring the equation into this form and

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.890
this is exactly the same form as we derived
in the last lecture by looking at similar

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.200
triangles.
What's really convenient and useful about

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.570
this homogeneous representation of the image
formation process is that it is completely

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.119
linear. We don't have this explicit division
by Z, the distance between the camera and

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.129
the object. It's implicit in the way we write
the equations in homogeneous form.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.860
Let's look at this equation again and we can
factor this matrix into two. The matrix on

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.180
the right has elements that are either 0 or
1 or f, the focal length of the lens. So this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.340
matrix performs the scaling and zooming. It’s
a function of the focal length of our lens.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.560
The matrix on the left has got an interesting
shape, it’s only a 3 x 4 and this matrix

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.090
performs the dimensionality reduction, crunches
points from three dimensions down into two.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.989
And so far, we consider the image plane to
be continuous. In reality, the image plane

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.360
is quantized. It consists of a massive array
of light sensing elements which corresponds

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.569
to the pixels in the output image. The dimension
of each pixel in this grid, I’m going to

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.940
denote by the Greek letter Pu. So the pixels
are Ρu wide and they’re Ρv high. Pixels

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.060
are really really small so the width and height
of a pixel is often at the order of around

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.200
10 microns, maybe a bit bigger, maybe a bit
smaller.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.080
What we need to do now is to convert the coordinate
P which we computed previously and that was

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.409
in units of meters with respect to the origin
of the image plane.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.769
We need to convert it to units of pixels and
our pixel coordinate system has got a different

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.840
origin as we talked about in earlier lectures.
Pixel coordinates are measured from the top-left

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.580
corner of the image so we need to do a scaling
and we need to do a shifting and that’s

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.190
a simple linear operation. So if we have the
Cartesian x and y coordinates of the point

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.510
P on the image plane, we can convert that
to the equivalent pixel coordinate which we

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.370
denote by the coordinates u and v and we can
represent that again in homogeneous form.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.340
Here we multiplied by a matrix, the elements
of the matrix are the dimensions of the pixel

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.769
Pu and Pv and the coordinates of what’s
called the principal point. The principal point is

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.620
the pixel coordinate where the z
axis of the camera origin frame

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.920
pierces the image plane. The homogeneous pixel coordinates can be converted

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.040
to the more familiar Cartesian pixel coordinates
u and v by the transformation rule that we

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.799
covered earlier.
Essentially, we take the first and second

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.520
element of the homogeneous vector and divide
it by the third element of the homogeneous

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.610
vector.
Now, we can put all these pieces together

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.639
and we can write the complete camera model
in terms of three matrices. The product of

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.030
the first two matrices is typically denoted
by the symbol K and we refer to these as the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.270
intrinsic parameters. All the numbers in these
two matrices are functions of the camera itself.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.449
It doesn't matter where the camera is where
it’s pointing, they’re only a function

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.070
of the camera. These numbers include the height
and width of the pixels on the image plane,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.009
the coordinates of the principal point and
the focal length of the lens.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.410
The third matrix describes the extrinsic parameters
and these describe where the camera is but

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.039
they don’t say anything about the type of
camera.

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.110
The elements in this matrix are a function
of the relative pose of the camera with respect

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.680
to the world origin frame. In fact, it is
the inverse of xi C.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.169
The product of all of these matrices together
is referred to as the camera matrix and it’s

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:27.270
often given the symbol C.
So this single matrix, this single 3 x 4 matrix

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.539
is all we need to describe the mapping from
a world coordinate, X, Y and Z through to

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.660
a homogeneous representation of the pixel
coordinate on the image plane. That homogeneous

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.389
image plane coordinate can be converted to
the familiar Cartesian image plane coordinate

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.530
using this transformation rule here. So this
is a very simple and concise way of performing

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.580
perspective projection.
Let’s consider now what happens when I introduce

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.819
a non-zero scale factor λ. The homogeneous
coordinate elements ũ, ṽ and w̃ will

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:08.889
all be scaled by λ. When I convert them to
Cartesian form, the λ term will be factored

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.580
out, it's in the numerator and the denominator so
the result will be unchanged. This is a particular

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.270
advantage of writing the relationship in homogeneous
form. It gives us what’s called scaling variance.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.000
Because we can multiply the matrix by an arbitrary

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.330
scale factor, it means we can write the camera
matrix in a slightly simplified form, which

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.990
we refer to as a normalized camera matrix.
We do that by choosing one particular element

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.110
of that matrix to have a value of 1 and typically
we choose the bottom right element and set it to 1.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.250
This normalized camera matrix still contains

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.500
all of the information to completely describe
the image formation process. It contains the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.830
focal length of the lens, it contains the
dimensions of the pixels, it contains the

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.620
coordinate of the principal point and it contains
the position and orientation of the camera

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.830
in three dimensional space. And finally, we can convert the homogeneous pixel coordinates

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.020
to the more familiar Cartesian pixel coordinates
which we denote by u and v.
