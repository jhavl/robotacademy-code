00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.240
The robots that we looked at so far move in
the 2D plane but most useful robots move in

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.540
three dimensions. What we want to do now is
to determine the pose of the end effector

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.359
of this robot which moves in three dimensional
space. The process we follow is very, very

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.609
similar to the process we did for the two
dimensional robots. First of all we introduced

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.100
a reference coordinate frame and then we indicate
the part of the robot the object whose pose

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.540
we’re interested in, that’s the end effector
of the robot indicated here by the symbol ksi E.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.520
The first step then is a rotation of the coordinate
frame about the z axis by an amount Q1. Then

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.510
we translate that coordinate frame in the
x direction by an amount A1 the length of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.380
the first link. Then we rotate the coordinate
frame about the z axis again by an amount Q2.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.199
Next we translate in the X direction by an
amount A2 that’s the length of the second

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.250
link. Then we rotate around the Z axis again
by the angle Q3 and finally we translate in

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.950
the Z direction by the amount Q4.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.909
We now have described the pose of the robot’s
end effector as a chain, a sequence of elementary

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.030
homogeneous transformation matrices. All of
the matrices belong to the set SE3 that’s

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.729
the set of all rotations and translations
in three dimensional space. We could expand

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.310
out each of these elementary matrices and
multiply them all together to come up with

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.829
a single homogeneous transformation metric
representation the pose the end effector of

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.610
this Scara robot. This small robot has gone
four degrees of freedom, four rotational joints.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.790
So the first rotation is around an axis like
this. You see that the whole arm rotates around

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.130
the base. The second rotating joint has got
an axis like this and we can say that the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.399
whole arm can rotate around this axis here.
The third joint is rotation around this axis,

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.560
you see that longer arm rotates around that
and the fourth joint is a rotation around

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.100
an axis here. You can see that the whole group
of mechanism rotates with respect to the lower arm.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.240
Let’s finish off by looking at this four
joint educational robot. We've had quite a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.379
bit of practice by now that we should be able
to write down the expression for the robot

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.190
end effector pose almost by inspection.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.440
So this is the way I think about the problem.
I imagine that the robot is stretched down

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.879
vertically with its two fingers pointing to
the sky and then I just write down the sequence

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.950
of transformations. First of all the robots
rotates around the reference Z axis by the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.459
amount Q1 and then we move up a little bit
which is in the Z direction and then we rotate

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.120
around the Y axis by the amount Q2.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.409
Then we move up a little bit and encounter
the next joint, joint 3 we rotate around the

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.430
Y axis by the amount Q3 then we move up a
bit more in the Z direction encounter the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.739
last joint, joint 4 we rotate around the Y
axis by the joint angle Q4. And then we move

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.890
up a bit more in the Z direction until we
reach the tip of the fingers.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.489
So just by mentally walking through the robot
mechanism joint by joint, link by link we

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.810
can write down an expression for the pose
of the end effector. Then it’s a simple

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.560
a matter of expanding out the matrices and
then multiplying them all together. And we

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.769
can use a tool like MATLAB to make that very
easy for us.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.110
Now we’re going to use MATLAB to determine
the pose of the end effector of this robot

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.790
which moves in three dimensions and we’re
going to do this symbolically but first of

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.049
all I’m going to define some symbolic variables
for the various link lengths A1, A2, A3, and

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:04.189
A4 and also for the four joint angles Q1,
Q2, Q3 and Q4. We’re going to use the trchain

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.700
function again. This time we’re going to
use the function called trchain which operates

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.689
in three dimensions rather than the function
trchain2 which operates in two dimensions

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.620
that we used in the previous examples.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.239
And now I start to write this transform string
so we’re going to do a rotation around the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.630
Z axis by Q1 and then we’re going to do
a translation in the Z direction by A1 then

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.580
we’re going to do a rotation around the
Y axis by Q2 and then we’re going to do

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.470
another translation in the Z direction by
A2 and then we’re going to do a rotation

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.210
around the Y axis by Q3 and then we’re going
to do another translation in the Z direction

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.340
by A3 and then we’re going to do a rotation
around the Y axis by Q4 and finally a translation

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.160
in the Z direction by A4.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:07.800
I close that string and now I pass in the
joint angles Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 and here we

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.320
have the expression for the homogeneous transformation
which represents the pose of this robot which

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.720
moves in three dimensions. Because the robot’s
operating in three dimensions this homogeneous

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.000
transformation is a four-by-four matrix. And
we can see that it’s quite a large and complex

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.729
expression and I need to scroll sideways quite
a lot to get to end of it.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.210
If I wanted to determine the X coordinate
of the end effector of this robot I would

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.780
do that by taking the element in the first
row and the forth column of this homogeneous

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.500
transformation matrix and that would be the
expression for the X coordinate of this robot

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.750
and again that itself is quite a complex expression.
