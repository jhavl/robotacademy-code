00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.020
Like most people I’ve grown up with images
of robots like this one from Lost in Space,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.900
but real robots are not like this. The real
robots and the ones we are going to see in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.400
the next few minutes have got a great diversity
of form and function. We are going to see

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.220
robots that can move through corridors, we
are going to see robots that can swim under

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.580
water, robots that can fly, robots that can
do assembly work. They all look very different

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.710
and they are nothing like the robots that
we have grown up with on TV and in the movies.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.290
What’s common to all these robots although
they are different, the common feature is

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.600
that they perform fundamentally three actions.
They sense the world and we are going to look

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.690
at a variety of sensors that robots use to
sense the world and then they make some plan,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.540
they take what they perceive about the world
through their senses and they have got a goal

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.470
that they are trying to achieve. So they plan
on how to move a bit closer towards the goal.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.910
And then they perform an action. It might
be to swim forward, it might be to fly, it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.330
might be to move down the corridor. And then
it repeats; it senses again how the world’s

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.280
changed, it updates its plan and moves some
more. So robots are continually doing sensing

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.600
planning and acting in a continuous loop.
So let’s go and look at some real robots.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.680
This is an example of an industrial robot.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
Machines like this are direct descendants

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.590
of the first robots that went into service
in the 1950's. This is a very big industrial

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.830
robot. Robots like these you will typically
find in a car factory doing jobs like spray

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.060
painting, welding, or lifting parts of car
bodies. This particular robot can lift up

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.260
to 60kgs. It's driven by 6 electric motors
and they rotate the machine around different

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.730
axes. So, the first motor rotates the robot
about an axis like this; the next motor rotates

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.580
it about an axis like this; next motor rotates
it about an axis like this. Down here we have

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.380
what we call the wrist mechanism. This assembly
here; and that contains three motors and they

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.540
rotate the end effector of the robot; the
bit that does the work; they rotate it about

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.389
an axis like this, like this and another one
like this. So these six motors allow the end

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:08.299
effector of the robot to move independently
in the X direction, the Y direction and the

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.139
Z direction. And also to rotate independently
about the X axis like that; about the Y axis

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.939
which is motion like that; and about the Z
axis which is motion like that.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.820
This is the Guiabot. This is a mobile robot.
Unlike the last robot that we looked at this

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.579
robot has the ability to autonomously move
through an environment. To enable it to do

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.880
that, it has a rich collection of sensors.
This sensor is probably familiar to you, it’s

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.840
a Kinect camera. We call it a 3D camera. It
outputs the three dimensional structure of

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.989
the world around the robot. And it needs that
three dimensional structure so that it can

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.209
determine what's an obstacle - a place that
it shouldn't drive - and what's free space

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.169
– that’s space where it is okay for it
to drive. The robot also has got this pair

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.660
of cameras here, we call this a stereo camera
pair, and it mimics the function of our own

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.820
two eyes. We use our two eyes to determine
the 3D structure of the world. So the robot

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.660
uses this to provide augmented 3D information
about its world. The robot’s also got a

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.010
very interesting camera on the top. We call
this an omnidirectional camera. It's actually

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.760
made up of six individual cameras which look
in all these different directions as well

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.530
as vertically. It integrates that together
to give almost a hemispherical view of the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.250
world. A very, very wide angle view.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.030
Other features of this robot are also interesting.
Down here we have a sensor that we call a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.870
laser scanner. This is essentially an optical
bumper bar. It is the sensor of last resort

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.190
to stop the robot bumping into something that
it shouldn't bump into. The robot has also

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.230
got a lot of computing power onboard. We see
here we have got two Mac Minis in addition

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.190
to a computer which is in the base and that
provides the computational power to process

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.540
the information from all the sensors to plan
how it should move and to control the motion

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.100
of the wheels. This robot has got a very strong
sense of where it is; it actually builds up

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.100
a map of its world; a two dimensional and
a 3 dimensional map. It knows where it is

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.570
within that world and the fundamental information
it needs in order to be able to achieve a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.690
goal. So it can sense, it's got planning computers
here and that sends actions through to the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.650
motors and it continually repeats this sensing,
planning, acting paradigm.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.640
Here we have another mobile robot and this
is a giant one. Machines like these are called

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.210
hot metal carriers. They are a relative of
the forklift truck. They are typically found

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.870
in aluminium smelting facilities and their
job is to pick up very large buckets like

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.690
this one you can see in the foreground here
which will be filled with molten aluminium

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.020
- 8 tonnes of molten aluminium. Their job is
to pick up this bucket, lift it and carry

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.340
it along a road network to another place within
this smelting complex.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.470
This machine was originally driven by a person
who would sit in a cab here and manipulate

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.710
the controls, but this particular machine
has been turned into a robot. In order for

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.560
it to be an effective robot, it needs to use
a number of different sensors so that it avoids

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.030
hitting things or people that it shouldn't
hit, that it can determine where it is within

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.610
the smelter complex, and also to be able to
successfully pick up the crucible.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.240
Now, let's look at the pick up process. The
vehicle itself has got this hook which it

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.890
needs to put in through this handle. So it's
a relatively precise positioning problem that

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.250
the robot needs to solve. Now it does that
by using a camera which is up here on the

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.510
mast of the robot, which looks down and works
out where this bucket is with respect to the

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.990
robot, and the robot moves so as to bring
this hook in through this handle.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.520
Another really important sensor on this robot
is this yellow laser scanning device, and

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.070
there’s actually four of them, one on each
corner of the robot so that it can see all

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.750
the way around. This performs two functions.
One is the laser beams can detect something

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.610
like me, an obstacle, and it would then stop
so it wouldn't collide with me. But it also

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.690
performs a really important navigation task.
This is how the robot knows where it is within

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.750
the complex. So to understand how that works
we are going to go outside and look at one

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.310
of the navigation markers that this sensor
picks up.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.120
The robot works out where it is in the environment
using a system of markers. In this particular

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.730
case these strips of reflective tape which
give really bright returns on the laser scanners

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:12.090
those yellow devices that we saw on the corners
of the hot metal carrier. Now the robot has

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:17.660
got a map that tells it whereabouts all these
markers are within the complex. And then it

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:23.200
uses the information about where the robot
perceives these markers to be and it combines

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.680
both of those together to determine where
the robot is with respect to the map.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.520
Here we have another kind of mobile robot.
This one is mobile in the air. It's a small

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:49.899
scale helicopter - it's a sort of thing that
a hobbyist would own. Sort of thing that they

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:55.839
might fly on the weekend and they fly it using
joystick controls that requires quite a lot

00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:00.709
of skill on their part in order to keep it
in the air and go where they want it to go.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:04.540
This particular machine has been converted
into a robot but before we talk about the

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.709
robotic part, let’s just talk a little bit
about the helicopter machine itself because

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:10.639
they are fascinating things.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:14.370
This is powered by a small petrol engine;
there is a fuel tank down here that carries

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:20.670
the fuel. And the main lift force comes from
the main rotor that provides a force vector

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.910
vertically upwards, which counteracts the
weight of the vehicle - counteracts gravity.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.899
The amazing thing with the helicopter is it
can point the force vector in different directions.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:34.120
It can point it forward, it can point it backwards,
it can point it sideways and that's all done

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.339
by this mechanism here called the swash plate
and what that does is every time the blades

00:09:39.339 --> 00:09:44.809
rotate, they also rotate this way about their
axis so that allows this force vector to be

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:50.360
controlled and that gives it the ability to
move forward, backwards, sideways and hover.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.100
There is another propeller on the back here
and that provides a force to stop the whole

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.639
body of the helicopter rotating around.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:03.970
In order to turn it into a robot, we need
to add some sensors to it. So in this box

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.769
down here, there are some sensors such as
GPS which tells it where it is with respect

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:13.410
to the world. There are some accelerometers
and gyroscopes that tell it its orientation

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.779
in space. There is a laser altimeter here
which tells it its height above the ground

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:23.579
and in the front is a radar which detects
obstacles that it might fly into.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.880
So, a robotic helicopter like this is useful for many kinds of tasks. It's useful for automated inspection:

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:36.120
perhaps on a farm it could inspect the quality
of crops, it could fly along creeks and waterways,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.400
it could fly along electricity lines or along
fence lines.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.200
Here we have another type of mobile robot
but this robot is mobile through water.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.840
We use robots like this to make scientific measurements about large volumes of water like lakes

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.780
or coastal zones. It looks quite simple but is actually quite a complex and sophisticated machine.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.589
Let’s walk through it. Down at
this end we have a propeller that pushes the

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:12.240
whole robot through the water. It's got some
control fins, rudder is here to steer it through

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.319
the water body and these planes here make
it move up and down in the water column. This

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:21.329
antenna stack here has got a GPS receiver
so when it's on the water surface it knows

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:25.069
where it is, and it has got some other antennas
that allow us to communicate with it when

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:30.079
it is out at sea. Here we have sonar sensors
- side scan sonar - which uses sound waves

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:35.860
to build up a three dimensional map of the
sea bed as the robot passes over it. Up here

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.079
we have some sensors that measure the speed
of the ocean current. Even though the robot

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:43.759
is moving, they can measure the speed of the
water column. Underneath there is another

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:49.470
sensor that measures the speed of the robot
with respect to the water column. Up the front

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.389
here is the scientific payload and this is
the instrumentation that we want to push through

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:59.339
the water to make measurements about what's
going on. So here we have sensors that measure

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:03.639
the conductivity and pH of the water; that
measure the amount of dissolved oxygen; that

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:08.439
measure the amount of chlorophyll; measures
the amount of blue green algae. So this scientific

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:12.949
data is merged with navigational data which
comes from the other sensors on board the

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.920
robot, so we know where these measurements
have been taken.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.840
This particular robot has got a runtime of up to 8 hours, moves about 2 meters per second,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
so we can survey about 30 kilometres in water in a single run.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.559
So what we have just seen are a number of
really interesting, exciting and clearly useful

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:44.839
robots. These robots differ in their form
and in their function, but inside these robots

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:49.470
are all doing the same thing. They are sensing
their world, they are making plans and then

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.490
they are they are carrying out actions in
order to achieve their goals. Some of the

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.779
robots that we saw were clearly research prototypes,
but others were commercial products. And this

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:04.959
is really exciting because this is the beginning
of a whole new technological wave and we have

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:10.290
witnessed many technological waves in the
past. The introduction of steam power, electricity,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:16.089
flying machines, automobiles, electricity,
computers; all these things were surprising

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:21.740
to our grandparents and to our parents. Robots
are just going to be the next technological

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.850
wave and in the near future, we are going
to be quite unsurprised to see them in our

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:32.370
workplaces and in our homes. So there are
clearly really interesting times ahead.
