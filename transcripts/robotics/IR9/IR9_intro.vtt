00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.680
In the last lecture, we talked about the relationship
between the velocity of a robot's joints and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.940
the velocity of the robot end-effector, the
rate of change of the pose of the robot end-effector.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.210
And, we talked previously about these two
robotic problems, the forward kinematic problem

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.670
and the inverse kinematic problem and then
we introduced this velocity transform problem.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.019
In our last lecture, we did everything in
two-dimensional space. This we have seen a

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.230
number of times through this course. Things
are pretty easy in two dimensions. They get

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.350
much more complex in three dimensions. In
this lecture, we are going to do it in three

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.670
dimensions.
So now, we are going to define what does it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.190
mean, this psi dot, in terms of three-dimensional
pose changing with time. So, first, we’re

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.880
going to describe what mathematical object this
psi dot is and then we’re going to work on

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.020
the relationship between joint angle rates
and pose rate.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.610
Now, as we do this, there are some advanced
concepts and, if you are not particularly

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.050
strong at maths, you don’t have background
in differential calculus, your not too comfortable

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.500
with linear algebra and we've done a bit of
linear algebra already. We used matrices and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.209
vectors, but this is going to be perhaps matrix
and vector used at a more advanced level.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.830
If you are not too comfortable with these
concepts, you might struggle with this particular

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.950
lecture. So, your options are just to try
and skim through the lecture, observe the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.920
gist of what I’m trying to say even if you
don’t get all of the details. Maybe look

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.110
at some, some additional textbooks. Do some
more reading to get the, the prerequisites

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.640
that you are going need to understand that.
So, just a little bit of a, of a warning before

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.360
we get in to the details of it.
