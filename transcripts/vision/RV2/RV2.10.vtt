00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.880
Let’s summarise some of the key things that
we have learned about getting images from

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.789
the world into a computer where we can manipulate
them with MATLAB.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:19.010
We have looked at a number of examples about
how we can load images from a file; load images

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.890
live from a camera; load images from somebody
else’s camera, a web camera attached to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.130
the internet somewhere on the planet; how
to load frames from a movie file and we can

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.890
even load frames from an online internet service
like Google Earth.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.750
What you will notice about all of these different
approaches is that there’s some common patterns

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.079
here. We create an image source object that
might be a video camera object or an access

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.420
web camera object or movie object and then
we use one of the methods of that object,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.079
the grab method, to obtain the next image
from that image source. So we are able to

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.080
grab images a diversity of image sources,
using software which varies only very, very

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.329
little.
Now once we have the image into the MATLAB

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:17.249
environment it is represented by a matrix;
by a rectangular array of numbers. Every element

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:23.119
within that array represents the intensity
of light at the corresponding point in the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.529
real world.
We refer to these elements as picture elements,

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:34.140
which is often contracted to pixel. The position
of a pixel is defined by two coordinates.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.340
The horizontal coordinate which I denote by
the symbol u, is the distance from the left-hand

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.000
edge, and the vertical coordinate which I
define by the symbol v, is defined as the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.679
distance from the top left-hand corner.
MATLAB is a computational environment for

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.130
dealing with matrices, and the convention
for matrices is that we index them using the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.859
row index first followed by the column index.
Now the row is the vertical coordinate and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.550
the column is the horizontal coordinate. So
there is a flip here between the normal way

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.910
that we represent the coordinates in a rectangular
frame or in a graph. Normally we would reference

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.580
the horizontal coordinate followed by the
vertical coordinate—we would write u,v as

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.040
the coordinate of a pixel. In MATLAB, because
we are indexing into a matrix we have to reverse

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.000
that so we would write v,u.
Now this is confusing and it is a bit of a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.760
trap for people who are just starting out.
It is really important to remember that the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.091
coordinates when you are indexing a matrix
are reversed compared to the coordinates that

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:46.910
you would use when you think about a two dimensional
plane.
