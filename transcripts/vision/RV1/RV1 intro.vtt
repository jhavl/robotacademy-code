Welcome to this first lecture in the Robotic
Vision course, in this first lecture we are

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:25.410
going to recap about robots, how they work,
and their need for senses. And then we're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
going to talk about senses more broadly the
sort of senses that animals and people have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.010
and then we are going to focus on sort of
senses that robots have perhaps things like

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.070
GPS but in particular we are going to focus
on why it is that vision makes sense as a

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.770
sensor for robots, so my job in this lecture
is to make the case for why vision is a great

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.070
sensor for robots.
