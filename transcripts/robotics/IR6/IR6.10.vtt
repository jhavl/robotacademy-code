00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.430
A really important consideration with any
robot is the set of all possible points that

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.510
it can reach.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.599
And we refer to this volume as the workspace
of the robot.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.050
For most industrial robot arms in the data
sheet that comes with the robot, you could

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.380
find the diagram that looks something like
this.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.920
It is a plain view and side elevation view
of the robot.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.119
And what you can see here marked in blue is
the reachable volume of the robot.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.190
We can see that this volume around the body
of the robot where it cannot reach either.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.300
And this is due to mechanical limits on the
range of motion of particular joints or itâ€™s

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.170
an artifact of the robot control software
to prevent parts of the arm intersecting or

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.789
colliding with other parts of the robot's
arm or its base.
