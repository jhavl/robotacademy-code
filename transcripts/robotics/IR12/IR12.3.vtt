00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.660
In the next few sections, I want to talk about
some of the big challenges that confront all

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.699
of us as a society, as a people. The root
cause of the challenges that confront us are

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.320
essentially the world population growth. In
this graph here shows, three different scenarios.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
These are called medium growth model, which
has population of the planet topping out at

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.409
8.9 billion by the 2050.
The low growth model, which sees population

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:35.490
actually starting to decline after about the
year 2035 and the rather scary high growth

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.190
model which sees 10.6 billion people in the
planet by the year 2050. It's going to take

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.420
a few years before we can work out which of
these particular lines we are on.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.530
The consequences of more people on the planet
are many. For a start, we are going to need

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.600
more food. There are more mouths to be fed
on the planet.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.289
We are going to need more resources. Each
person requires resources such as energy to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.600
manufacture items that they need whether that's
housing or other sorts of goods. We need materials

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.100
like metals and petroleum resources and we
need water - water for drinking and also water

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.420
for washing and water for manufacturing, all
the items that these people require.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.610
And finally, there is going to need a whole
lot more transportation. We have more people

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.360
in the planet, more people will need to go
from point A to point B. All these resources

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.880
need to be transported from where they are
produced to where they are going to be used.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.049
So, increased amount of transportation for
people and the resources that the people require.
