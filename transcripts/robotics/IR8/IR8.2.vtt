00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.820
In this lecture we're going to consider how
the velocity of a single robot joint affects

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.799
the velocity of the end effector. Here a couple
of animations that show a simple two-linked

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.949
planar robot. On the left we see an example
where joint 1 of the robot is varying sinusoidally.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.090
On the right we see an example where joint
2 of the robot is varying sinusoidally. But,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.530
what we're interested in is the relationship
between the velocities of the individual joints

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.800
Q1 or Q2 and the velocity of the end effector.
In what we will be able to show is that instantaneously

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.500
the velocity of the end effector is the sum
of the end effector velocity components due

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.370
to motion of joint 1 and the motion due to joint 2.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.200
Here's the two-linked robot manipulator which
should be very familiar to us now. We showed

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.930
in the previous lecture about forward kinematics
how we can write an expression for the x and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.910
y coordinate for the robot end effector. That
is the robotâ€™s end effector pose in two dimensions.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.500
Now if we consider that the joint angles are
now are the function of time, then we can

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.170
compute the derivative of x and y with respect
to time and the dot notation here means the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.659
derivative with respect to time. So xdot is
the derivative of x with respect to time.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.109
Q1 dot is the derivative of the joint angle
Q1 with respect to time.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.990
Computing the derivative is fairly straight
forward. It's pretty much introductory differential

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.249
calculus and we need to apply the chain rule.
Let's bring the previous equations on to a

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.829
fresh page. And here again is the expressions
for the xdot and ydot.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.119
Now in this expressions you notice that there
are a number of Q1dot and Qdot terms. What

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.549
we can do is we can factor them out. And that
enables us to write the expression in a very

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.579
compact matrix form. If you uncomfortable
with this or don't understand how we got from

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.450
the first expression to the matrix form, multiply
out the matrix form. Multiply the 2x2 matrix

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.100
by 2x1 vector and convince yourself that it's
the same expression that we started with.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.640
We can now write this in a very succinct form.
The vector xdot and ydot is the velocity of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.800
the robot end effector. The matrix which is
typically denoted by the symbol J is referred

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.660
to as a Jacobian matrix. Note that this Jacobian
matrix is a function of the joint angles Q1

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.290
and Q2. So what we have here is a linear relationship
between the joint angle velocity, vector Qdot,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.750
which comprises Q1dot and Q2dot and the tip
velocity in Cartesian space xdot and ydot.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.390
The Jacobian matrix that we just introduced
is named after this gentleman. A 19th century

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.860
mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacoby. He's
been very familiar with a functional expression

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.370
like this, y is a function of x, x is a scalar
and y is a scalar. And then we could write

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.850
the derivative of the function x with respect
to x. It's the same as the derivative of y

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.360
with respect to x. The Jacobian is simply
the matrix equivalent of the derivative. It's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.570
the derivative of a function whose argument
is a vector and whose result is a vector.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.200
Now those vectors don't have to be the same
length. In this example, x is a vector of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.910
n dimensions and y is a vector of m dimensions.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.860
So the Jacobian as I said is a matrix and
it will be in this case an n by m matrix.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.830
The elements of the matrix are the partial
derivatives of each of the outputs of the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.990
function with respect to each of the inputs to the function. In a nutshell that's what a Jacobian is.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.360
When we talked about kinematics, we introduce
a functional form.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.080
We introduced the function K which operates
on the robot joint angles and returns the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.360
robot pose. Now for the two-link robot that
we're considering now, the joint angles belong

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.450
to the two dimensional space of real numbers
and the end effector post also belongs to

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.060
the two dimensional space or real numbers.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.310
The joint angle vector Q belongs to the space
of two dimensional real numbers, it's the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.349
set of numbers Q1 and Q2. And the end effector
post belongs to the two dimensional space

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.710
of real numbers. That saying that the end
effector post is represented by two real numbers

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.889
x and y. The other symbol that we introduced
a moment ago is the spatial velocity. And

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.740
we used the Greek letter nu, it looks like
a V and its handy because it is a type of

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.360
velocity but it's not just a velocity in the
plain. It also includes rotational velocity,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.660
That becomes really important when we talk about robots that operates on three dimensional space.
