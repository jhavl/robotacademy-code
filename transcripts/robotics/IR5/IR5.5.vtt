The final component of the inertia measurement
unit are the sensors that measure angular

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.550
velocity, and these are commonly referred
to as gyroscopes. You might have had a gyroscope

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.260
as a toy when you were a child, and it is
difficult to understand the relationship between

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.089
this toy gyroscope, which can balance on the
end of a pencil with a device that can measure

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.099
angular velocity. To understand how we can
use a gyroscope as an angular velocity sensor,

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.880
we need to get right back to fundamentals
of spinning bodies. Here, we have a disc which

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.110
is spinning about the axis shown by the dotted
line, and it is spinning with an angular velocity,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.250
omega g and the disc has got a rotational
inertia, j. We refer to the angular momentum

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.570
of this disc and give that the symbol h.
h is j times omega g. Now, let's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.730
imagine that I apply a torque to this rotating
disc. If I do that, the disc wants to rotate

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.380
about the axis shown by the blue arrow. It's
the cross product of the vector h and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.970
the vector Tau.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.572
What we have here is a gyroscope and at the
moment, the device is not spinning we can

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:13.060
see that it moves very freely and nicely inside
its gimbal mechanism. If I turn the motor

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.970
on, it takes a little moment to come up to
speed, it now behaves very very differently.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.700
Now, I'm going to rotate the spinning disc
assembly about the blue arrow and now; the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.060
spinning disc is going to exert a torque about
the red arrow, and that torque is the cross

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.850
product of the vectors omega and h.
So, how do I measure the torque? If the disc

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.549
axis is supported by two bearings then, this
torque will exert a force up on one bearing

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.700
and down on the other bearing, and those forces
can be measured. The spinning disc then has

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.979
converted the angular velocity omega into
a torque which is then, measured using force

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:51.979
sensors.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.570
Importantly, if I pull on this axis of the
gyroscope with a rubber band, I am basically

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.710
going to exert a force on it. And so, I pull
in this direction. You will see that the gyroscope

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.310
is trying to rotate about an axis like this.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.220
Angular velocity sensors based on spinning
discs are not very common anymore. They tend

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.870
to be rather bulky and require a lot of power
to keep that disc spinning. Sensors today

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.400
are based on vibrating rather than rotating
element, but we still tend to call them gyroscopes

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.490
or gyroscopic sensors. The vibrating elements
are fabricated using ‘MEMS’ technology.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.190
So, the sensing elements themselves are microscopic
in size but the underlying principle is the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.900
same. Angular velocity in the sensor causes
forces or torques to be exerted on the micro

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.950
scale elements and that leads to displacements,
which can be measured and amplified to produce

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.620
an angular velocity signal. As with accelerometers
and magnetometers it is very common to package

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.430
three gyroscope sensors into a single chip,
and they are arranged orthogonally again so

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.630
they measure the three components of the angular
velocity vector. Just as you have accelerometers

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.989
in your head, you also have gyroscopes in
your head and once again, these are in the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.050
inner ear assembly. In particular, the three
very distinctive elements known as the semi-circular

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.489
canals. These are very thin tubes filled with
fluid and rotational motion of your head causes

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.010
the liquid in those tubes to move. The motion
of a fluid is detected by tiny hair cells

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.569
within the canals, and this leads to an angular
velocity signal to your brain. The angular

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.769
velocity signal is combined with motion information
that comes from your eyes. If these two signals

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.240
are not consistent, it leads to a problem
which we experience as motion sickness, that's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.319
when our inner ear is telling us that our
body is moving in one way, but our eyes tell

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.720
us that our body is moving in a different
way. So, this is motion sickness or sea sickness,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290
and our body responds rather illogically by
wanting us to throw up.
