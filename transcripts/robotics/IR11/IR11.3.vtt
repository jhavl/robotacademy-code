00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.720
We're going to look at the results of the
recursive Newton-Euler algorithm again. But

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.610
this time, we're going to do the operations
symbolically using MATLAB’s computer algebra

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.089
capability.
The first thing we are going to do is to bring

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.939
in a model of the two link robot, that’s
the mdl_twolink with a suffix sym to indicate

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.500
that it is a symbolic model. And once again,
we have a serial link object created in our

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.119
workspace called twolink.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.700
Because I am going to work with symbols rather
than numbers, I need to actually define my

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.380
variables in advance. So, I'm going to define
a symbolic variable called Q1 and Q2. And

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.810
Q1D and Q2D to represent the velocity of joints
1 and joint 2 and Q1DD to represent the acceleration

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.780
of joint 1 and the acceleration of joint 2.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.260
Now that I have that, I can use the rne method
just as I did last time and I'm going to pass

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.600
in the joint angles which are the symbolic
variables Q1 and Q2. I am going to pass in

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.140
the, joint velocities which are the symbolic
variables Q1D and Q2D and I'm going to pass

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.330
in the symbolic variables for the joint acceleration
which is Q1DD and Q2DD.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.930
And, I'm going to save this into a variable
called tau. Do that while I remember. Here

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.380
we go. Here is the result.
So, if I look at the torque that is acting

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.770
on the first joint, here we have a symbolic
expression for that torque and it is a very

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.530
long and complex expression. We can see that
there are a number of kinematic parameters

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.901
in here like A1 and A2. We can see there are
joint accelerations, joint velocities. We

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:55.409
can see G, the gravitational acceleration
there are trigonometric terms. There are joint

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.760
masses. There is all sorts of stuff. It is
a very long and very complicated expression

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.880
for the torque acting on Joint 1 of our simple
two link robot.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.150
The torque acting on Joint 2, that's the elbow
joint robot, is a more concise expression.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.450
There are less complex forces and torques
acting on the second joint of robot. We can

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.189
see this very complex expression. Imagine
what it will be like for a six-link robot.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.200
Now, it is possible to factorize and simplify
those very complex expressions that we just

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.239
looked at. In particular, if we express it
in matrix form like this. Tau is a vector

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.230
of the applied joint torques. Q, of course,
is our joint coordinates, generally the joint

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.549
angles of the serial link manipulator. Q-dot,
the joint velocities, the rates of change

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.260
of the joint coordinates and Q-dot-dot is
the joint acceleration. G is a term which

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.959
represents the torque that's due to the gravity
acting on the robot manipulator and gravity

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.400
is a function only of the joint coordinates
Q. M is the inertia matrix and it is a function

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.540
only of the joint coordinates multiply by
the joint accelerations.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.200
This gives us the torque that's required to
accelerate our serial link manipulator. C

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.930
is referred to as the Coriolis and centripetal
term and this represents the gyroscopic and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.849
other forces that act on the robot joints
due to the rotation of other robot joints.
