00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.099
In this optional section what I want to do
is revisit the concept of eigenvalues and

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.509
eigenvectors, in case you’ve forgotten what
they are. They are a concept that we’re

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.730
going to need in the next segment.
So let’s consider a simple linear algebra

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.540
case. We have a vector, v. It’s an Nx1 vector,
and we’re going to pre-multiply it by a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.210
square matrix NxN, and the result will of
course be a vector, an Nx1 vector.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.300
Now for every matrix ‘A’, there are N
vectors whose direction is unchanged by A.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.300
That means the vector v and the vector v prime
will be parallel to each other. And these

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.520
vectors we refer to as eigenvectors.
Now, although the vector v and the vector

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.070
v prime will be parallel, they may not be
necessarily the same length. So the length

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.710
is scaled by the eigenvalue that corresponds
to the eigenvector.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.730
So that’s a lot of words. Let’s look at
a graphical example of this in practice.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.260
We’ve chosen a very simple A matrix; it’s
a 2 by 2 matrix, so there will be two eigenvectors

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.080
and eigenvalues. And you can see an eigenvalue
just about coming up … now. That’s the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.330
case where the red vector, the input vector,
and the blue output vector are parallel to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.180
one another. There’s another one … now.
Notice that they are parallel to each other

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.260
but they’re not the same length. So the
ratio of the length of the red vector to the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.530
blue vector is the eigenvalue.
So the term eigenvector … it’s a German

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.180
word and it means ‘own vector’. It’s
a special vector that belongs to the matrix.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
So there are a couple of equations that we
can write. First of all we can use the equation

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.790
that we had before: that v multiplied by the
matrix A gives us the output vector v prime.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.320
And in the particular case when they’re
parallel then they are related by a scalar;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.270
that the two vectors are parallel, only their
length is different. So we can represent that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.049
by the scalar factor lambda, which is an eigenvalue.
So if these two equations are true we can

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.090
write this, and we’re following through
some maths. We’re not interested in the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.080
case where v=0, we’re interested in the
case where the determinant of A minus lambda,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.680
I, is equal to 0. So if we can write that
expression for any matrix, it’s easy for

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.500
a 2 by 2 case, more difficult for 3 by 3,
very, very difficult for bigger matrices,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.930
and we can solve that for the values of the
eigenvalues; these lambda values.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.150
Once we have values for lambda we can substitute
them into the equations above and then solve

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.060
for the eigenvector.
Now there are an infinite number of eigenvectors

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.910
corresponding to which eigenvalue, so typically
we choose eigenvectors that have got a unit

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.980
length. That’s an additional constraint
that helps us choose just a single eigenvector.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.160
We’ll demonstrate this with a simple example:
with a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.900
The eigenvalues of this matrix are given simply
using the MATLAB built-in function eig. We

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.480
see the two eigenvalues are 1 and -2.
To find the eigenvectors is a little bit more

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.680
complex. We have to assign two output arguments
from the function eig, and the first output

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.190
argument which I’ve assigned to the matrix
x has got two columns. The first column is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.060
the first eigenvector. The second column is
the second eigenvector. And the eigenvalues

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.010
now are arranged along the diagonal of the
output matrix e.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.489
A fundamental property of the eigenvector
is that when it is transformed by the original

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.159
matrix, it is parallel to itself. Let’s
test that.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.090
The original matrix A, and we multiply it
by the first eigenvector which is the first

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:03.170
column of the matrix x. We see that the resulting
vector is indeed parallel to the eigenvector,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.280
and it has exactly the same magnitude. It’s
been scaled by 1, and that is the value of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:18.560
the first eigenvalue. So the eigenvector multiplied
by the matrix A is a vector parallel to the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.770
eigenvector with a scale factor of 1. So it
is, in fact, the original eigenvector.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.830
Let’s try it with the other eigenvector,
which is the second column of the matrix x.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.069
We see now that the result is indeed parallel
to the second eigenvector, but it’s been

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.919
scaled by -2, and -2 is the second eigenvalue
of the matrix A.
