00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.069
Let's recap some of the important topics we've
covered in this particular lecture. We've

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.130
talked about the fundamental image formation
process and the simplest case is what we call

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.380
the "Pinhole Camera." Light comes from a light
source, in this case the sun, reflects off

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.119
points on the three dimensional object, those
light rays pass through the pin hole and cause

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.760
a very faint inverted image to be formed on
the image plane.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.260
The geometry of this situation can be very
simply explained. It can be described using

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.600
similar triangles and that leads us to the
very simple relationship here between three

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.579
dimensional world co-ordinates, capital X,
capital Y, capital Z and the two dimensional

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.840
image plane co-ordinates little x and little y.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.239
So this is a mapping or a projection from
three dimensions down to two dimensions and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.219
this is called "Perspective Projection."

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.680
One of the disadvantages of the pinhole imaging
model is that a lot of the light rays are

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.720
lost; they simply hit the opaque plane that
holds the pinhole. If we introduce a lens

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.170
instead we're able to gather many more of
the rays that leave each particular point

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.270
on the object and that allows a brighter image
to be formed.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.250
A consequence of the perspective projection,
the mapping from three dimensions down into

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.680
two, is that some of the geometry is not preserved.
Here we see that parallel lines in the world

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.159
are no longer parallel lines in the image.
We see that a large circle in the world is

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.360
not a circle in the image. And perspective
projection guarantees only to do this, it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.630
will map a line to a line, but it doesn't
necessarily retain parallelism, angles are

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.130
not necessarily preserved and conic sections
are mapped to conic sections; so that means

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.720
that a circle could appear as an ellipse and
an ellipse could appear as a circle.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.219
A really important consequence of the perspective
projection is that there is no unique inverse.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.130
We've lost a dimension, so for a particular
image there are an infinite number of possible

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.629
objects that could have caused that image.
It could be a small object close to me or

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.810
it could be a large object further away. There
is no way, just from the image geometry that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.849
we can tell this.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.730
So in practice we use a number of tricks that
come from our experience from growing up in

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.520
a three dimensional world, in order to disambiguate
this. Though we can trick this. If we create

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.690
a two dimensional image; shown here as a piece
of street art, which causes on the retina

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.209
of our eye, exactly the same image as we would
get from looking at a three dimensional world,

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.959
then all of the three dimensional interpretation
part of our brain kicks in and causes us to

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.970
feel, to interpret the image as being three
dimensional even though the rational part

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.950
of our brain knows that this is a piece of
flat street art. The impression is still very,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.110
very vivid.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.620
Another way we can look at the consequence
of there being no unique inverse is in an

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.989
illusion like this and it's because Chris
is a full size person but because he's standing

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.569
further away he appears to be smaller and
although initially we're surprised when we

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.950
look at that, again the rational part of our
brain that understands the three dimensional

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.569
world kicks in and says "Okay, actually we
will assume that he is a full size person,

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.700
he therefore must be further away."
