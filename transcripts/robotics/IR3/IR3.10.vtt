00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.670
When we're discussing industrial type robots,
it's important to describe the orientation

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
of the end effector, the gripper - the piece
of the robot that does the work by picking

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.090
objects up and putting them down. The common
convention in this type of robotics is what's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.200
called the 2-axis representation. We start
off by defining a vector which is called the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.670
approach vector and that's the vector that's
parallel to the fingers of the robot. We define

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.980
another vector which we call the orientation
vector and that's the vector that joins the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.220
tips of two fingers. So that says something
about the twist of the robot fingers around

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.800
the approach vector. And for a lot of robotic
manipulation tasks, just knowing the approach

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.360
vector and the orientation vector is sufficient
to be able to describe the orientation of the gripper.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.020
In order to create a right-handed coordinate
frame we introduce a third vector just called

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.850
the normal vector. Now we can express the
orientation of the gripper as an orthonormal

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.359
rotation matrix. We do that by stacking up
as columns the N vector, the O vector and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:14.659
the A vector. We're can expand this out as
a 3 x 3 matrix and each column are the elements

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.969
of the N, O and A vectors. All of these columns
must be orthogonal. So if we know the A and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.799
the O vector, we can compute the N vector
as the cross product of the O and the A vector.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.389
Here's a quick recap on the rules that relate
the columns of an orthogonal matrix. A little

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:42.319
trick that I use to aid my memory is to consider
that N, O and A are written on a circular

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.340
strip of paper. We start with the symbol that
we want to know, and is equal to the cross

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.389
product of the next two around the circle.

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.340
Here I have a very simple robot and we have
our world coordinate frame here, which is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.729
our reference for both position and for orientation.
And this robot is going to pick up this battery.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.669
In order to do that, we need to describe both
the position and the orientation of the gripper.

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.170
It might be that we want to pick up the battery
with a gripper orientation like this or we

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
might want to pick up the battery with a gripper
orientation like this. Either way we need

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.660
to be able to describe the orientation of
the gripper. So we do what we've done before,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.890
with other objects. We attach a coordinate
frame to the gripper of the robot. We orient

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.620
it so that the z-axis is pointing outwards.
We refer to this as the approach vector. It's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.130
generally the direction in which the gripper
approaches the object. We have another vector

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.590
which we call the orientation vector and is
parallel to the y-axis of the gripper's coordinate

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.620
frame and that is the orientation of the gripper.
Do we want the gripper's fingers like this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.950
or like this. And the third vector, the x-axis
we refer to as the normal vector.
