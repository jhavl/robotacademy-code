00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.219
The control systems that we design for the
joints of our robot have got a long ancestry.

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.219
Human beings have been devising control systems
for a long time. It’s been part of our ongoing

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.100
process to harness the power of nature.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.410
Here’s the schematic of a device invented
by Hero of Alexandria around 2000 years ago

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.890
and its purpose was to maintain a constant
water level in the right most vessel. A constant

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.780
water level result in a constant pressure
and that was important for accurate time keeping

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.860
with a water powered clock.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.900
A related but more recent instance of this is the
control of water level in the system of a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.890
flush toilet. A very simple mechanism, if the
water level is less than the desired level,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.880
water flows into the tank and if the water
level is greater than or equal to the desired

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.600
level then it stops flowing into the tank.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.239
Here’s an innovation that was important
in harnessing wind power. If the main blades

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.710
are not pointing directly into the wind then
some wind will pass through the small fan

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.199
tail. And that will cause the whole top of
the windmill to rotate so it points

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.750
the main blades directly into the wind.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.710
A really important invention, perhaps under
pinned the industrial revolution, is the centrifugal

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.710
governor invented or at least perfected by
James Watt. If the steam engine is running

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.460
too fast then the centrifugal governor reduces
the amount of steam going into the engine.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.850
And similarly if the engine is going too slowly
it allows more steam into the engine and it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.510
allows the engine to run at constant speed
even though the load on the engine may be varying.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.229
It took a long time to come up with a general
theory of control and a lot of very smart

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.000
people contributed to this over a long period
of time. Harald Black, shown here in the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.920
middle, really formalized the theory of negative
feedback and that is you subtract the output

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.520
of the system from the desired input to the
system. This technique was patented by Black

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.130
to improve the performance of amplifiers used
in long distance telephone networks.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.650
A really big innovation in control came with
the introduction of affordable small digital

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.790
computers and perhaps one of the first and
perhaps best known examples of this was the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.670
small digital computer that was built to navigate
Apollo spacecraft to the moon and to guide

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.000
the lunar module from orbit onto the moon’s
surface.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.709
Here again is the diagram that shows the components
of a typical robot joint control system and

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.640
we see here the negative feedback loop where
we have the desired position and also feedback

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.500
of the actual position.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500
One part of the system that we haven’t yet
talked about is the position sensor. The most common

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.849
technique for sensing the angle of an electric
model is once called an incremental encoder.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.510
Here we can see some examples of incremental
encoders and typically the incremental encoder

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.959
is fitted to one end of the motor assembly.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.849
So these days you buy an integrated motor
assembly it’s an electric motor. It’s

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.369
got a gear box and it’s got an encoder which provides signals to tell you the angle of the motor shaft.

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:07.080
The principle of an incremental encoder is
pretty simple. We have a slotted disk on the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.790
motor shaft and a pair of LEDs shine light
through the slots and that are picked up by a pair

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.730
of photo detectors. The two LEDs are positioned
a half slot apart, so the output signals from

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.750
the detectors looks something like this when
the motor is spinning in the clockwise direction

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.069
and it looks something like this when the
motor is spinning in the counter clockwise direction.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.349
In order to determine the motor angle all
we need to do is to count the pulses but it’s

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.519
important to know whether we’re counting up or down and that depends on the direction of rotation.

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.720
The direction of rotation is actually very
easy to determine. We look at the rising edge

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.060
of the A signal and we measure the value of
the B signal. If the B signal is zero on the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.769
rising edge then we’re moving clockwise
and if the B signal is one on the rising edge

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.599
then the motor is rotating in the counter
clockwise direction.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.330
Incremental encoders are simple and cheap.
They give us the direction of rotation and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.690
also the rotational speed that comes from
the number of pulses per second. If we count

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.879
the pulses we can determine the angular position
of the motor shaft because the output signals

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.519
of the photo detectors are binary, very easy
to interface to a cheap micro controller.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.739
Another important component in the robot joint
control system is the micro controller. Modern

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.639
micro controllers pack an awful lot of functionality
into a very small package. They have analogue

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.499
input and output, digital input and output,
perhaps they've got serial ports.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:34.490
Internally they have a large number of counters
and timers and pulse with modulation generators

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.469
in addition to a small computer with RAM and
sometimes non-volatile memory as well. They’re

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.699
easy to interface to a network to a keyboard
and a display; very, very versatile and today

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.129
very, very low cost devices.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.889
Finally the robot joint controller looks something
like this. We have the joint controller itself

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.919
which is an algorithm running in the joint
controller inside an embedded micro processor.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.439
Typically it outputs a pulse-width-modulated
signal to the motor drive, which is this H

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.379
bridge circuit that drives the actuator, a
small electric motor. There is a gearbox which

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:15.009
connects the electric motor to the robot joint
and we use a gearbox to amplify the relatively

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.129
low torque from the electric motor to the
larger torque which is needed to move the

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.800
link of the robot.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.939
We use an incremental encoder to measure the
position of the motor shaft and we can pair

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.969
that with the desired position that we want
the joint to have that goes into the joint

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.719
controller and the loop is closed.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:39.180
We can create a dynamic model of that robot
joint controller system. A critical part of

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.869
this is the summing junction. This is where
we input the desired position of the robot

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.860
joint and we subtract from that actual position.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.589
This is the essence of a negative feedback
system, the desired position minus the actual

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.719
position. The result of that is the error
in position and that goes into a control law.

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.069
The output of the control law is a signal
that goes to the motor driver and applies

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:07.089
some arbitrary gain I call it KD and generates
a current is applied to the transfer function

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.099
for the actuator, which is shown here.

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.659
The result of which is position of the motor.
We have a sensor, which measures the position

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.219
of the motor and our model that by a gain
of one and this is the signal, which is subtracted

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.519
from the desired position.
