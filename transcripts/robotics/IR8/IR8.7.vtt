00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.180
Here we have something that should be quite
familiar to us by now. We have a coordinate

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.380
frame denoted A and we have a point. Now that
point is moving. It’s got a spacial velocity,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.000
nu, with respect to frame A and I denote it
this way. It’s got translational velocity

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.290
component, X dot and Y dot and a rotational
velocity component theta dot but I represent

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.399
that by a single arrow.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.340
Now I am going to introduce another coordinate
frame, a red coordinated frame denoted B and

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.890
we have a relative pose that describes the
pose of frame B with respect to the pose of

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.010
frame A. Now I can also describe the velocity
of the point with respect to coordinate frame

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.890
B and I do that by using a leading super script
B instead of A.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.280
Now, the velocity of the point with respect
to frame B is related to the velocity with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.420
respect to frame A and it’s related by a
Jacobian matrix, a Jacobian that maps velocity

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.339
from one frame to another.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.090
This particular Jacobian is a function of
the relative pose between the two frames.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.110
It’s a three by three matrix that comprises
the rotational part of the relative pose and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.790
a bunch of zeros and ones. In fact, it is
only a function of the relative orientation

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.130
between the frames. It doesn't depend at all on the distance between the origins of these two frames.
