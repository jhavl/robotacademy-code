00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.840
Magnetic field is measured using a sensor
called a magnetometer.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.630
The most common type of solid state magnetometer
is a Hall effect sensor and it measures the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.400
magnetic field normal to the chip surface.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.409
It’s very useful to be able to measure the
three orthogonal components of magnetic field

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.409
vector.

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.970
So typically, three orthogonal Hall effect
sensors are packaged in to a single chip along

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.970
with all the associated electronics and typically
these have a simple serial interface that

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.720
allows them to be easily connected to a
micro-controller.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.980
So, in order to determine the orientation
of a body in space, we use the accelerometers

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.440
to determine the downward direction, the direction
of the gravity vector.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.420
And, we use that to determine the magnetic
field component in the horizontal plane which

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.579
we can think of as being the same as the direction
of the needle points on a traditional mechanical

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.980
compass.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.750
To make this tangible, consider again the
example of my phone and I have attached a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.429
body frame to the phone.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.350
The z-axis is out of the screen, y-axis is
up the screen and the x-axis is across the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.220
screen from left to right.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.070
I’m going to align a magnetometer with each
of these axes and the result is called a tri-axial

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.250
magnetometer because there are three magnetometers
there.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.720
Let’s talk now about how we process the
information from the magnetometer.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.990
Once again, I have a world coordinate frame
denoted zero.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.920
Once again, the z-axis is parallel to the
gravity vector.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.340
It’s pointing straight upwards.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.600
And, the x-axis is aligned with the magnetic
north.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.860
In this case, I can write the magnetic field
vector with respect to the world reference

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.670
coordinate frame as B, the magnitude of the
magnetic field vector which I can look up

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.810
in a table if I know my location on the planet,
and the cosine and sine of the magnetic inclination

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.810
angle.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.421
This vector lies in the x-z plane.

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.530
It has got no component in the y direction.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.860
The rotational transform from the world frame
to the body frame is given in terms of the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.230
roll, pitch and yaw angles.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.730
We have already talked about how to determine
the roll and pitch angles from the accelerometer

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.730
measurements.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.060
The magnetometers in the phone measure the
magnetic field in the coordinate frame B and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.440
that allows me to write this relationship.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.720
And, now we can solve for the yaw angle psi
and it is in terms of the roll and pitch angles

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.540
that we determined from the accelerometer
measurements.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.569
The measured magnetic field strength, BX,
BY and BZ, the known length of the magnetic

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.420
field vector, capital B, and the known inclination
angle, capital I.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.140
And both B and I, we can look up if we know
our location on the surface of the planet.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.510
The magnetic field of the earth is quite weak.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.140
Therefore, magnetometers need to be very sensitive
to magnetic field and this makes magnetometers

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.230
very susceptible to stray magnetic fields
that are created by electric currents flowing

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.370
inside electronic devices and also from electric
motors.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.740
Roboticists building robots that operate
indoors are often frustrated by the structural

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.220
steel elements of the building which distort
the earth’s magnetic field.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.430
There are also power cables in the walls and
there are Wi-Fi access points and equipment

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.459
closets which also create magnetic field which
can confuse robots that rely predominantly

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.380
on magnetic field sensing.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.569
I really like this old picture of the Pioneer
ten satellite which is exploring the far reaches

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.819
of our solar system. There’s a bunch of
electronics and a rocket motor on the back

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.950
of a large dish which is pointed back at Planet
Earth.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.590
And, on a long slender boom is the magnetometer
instrument which is sensing the local magnetic

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.240
field and they’ve position that is far away
as they can from the rest of the electronics

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240
in the space craft.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.790
And, that’s for exactly this reason that
magnetometer is very sensitive to stray magnetic

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.819
fields.
