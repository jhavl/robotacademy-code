00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.910
A commonly used alternative velocity profile looks like this.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
We accelerate. We move at constant velocity for as long as we need to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
and then we slow down as quickly as we can.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.910
An advantage of a trajectory like this is
that we get to our destination much more quickly.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.369
The area under the two curves is the distance
travelled, and that's the same in the two

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.009
cases. It’s just that the red curve is much
more compact. It only takes 35 time units

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.620
instead of 50 time units.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.120
This kind of motion is referred to as a trapezoidal
profile. It's named after the shape of the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.040
velocity profile. It’s a trapezoid. It comprises
an acceleration phase, a coasting phase - where

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.280
we move at a constant velocity - and then a
deceleration phase. During acceleration and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.110
deceleration, the velocity is a linear function
of time. Which means, that position is a parabolic

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.200
function of time. During the coasting phase,
the velocity is constant. That means that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.520
the position profile is a straight line. So,
this kind of motion profile, the trapezoidal

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.659
profile, is also sometimes referred to as
a linear segment with parabolic blend. In

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.969
that robotics toolbox, it's the function LSPB
which is a contraction of a linear segment

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.810
with parabolic blend.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.959
A disadvantage of the trapezoidal profile
is that acceleration is not continuous and

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.880
you can see it when we change from acceleration
phase to coasting phase and coasting to deceleration

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.899
phase, there is a step discontinuity in acceleration.
This is potentially problematic for some robots

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.090
but in general, we rely on the fact that the
bandwidth of the motion control systems is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.770
relatively low and it smooths out this discontinuity
in acceleration.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.969
Let's look at this type of trajectory using
the MATLAB tools, I am going to create a trapezoidal

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.979
trajectory using the MATLAB function LSPB
which is an acronym for Linear Segment with

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.929
Parabolic Blend. It's going to start with
the value of zero. It's going to finish at

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.980
one. We're going to do it in 50 times steps.
And, here we see the trajectory. We can clearly

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.810
see that the velocity profile is trapezoidal.
We can see the acceleration phase, the constant

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.980
velocity phase and the deceleration phase.
And, these different phases are color coded

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.989
in the plot of S versus time step. I can change
the trajectory. So, instead of going from

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.980
zero to one, it goes from zero to minus one.
And, the trajectory now looks like this. So,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:49.269
then, I can ask for the values of S, from
zero to one in 50 times steps. And it creates

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.049
a vector in the workspace code S which has
50 rows. Each row corresponds to a time step.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.819
And just like the tpoly function, I can also
ask for the velocity and the acceleration

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.290
which in turn, we put into the workspace SD
and STD and here they are also in the workspace

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.340
as 50 element vectors, one row per time step.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.510
I'm going to return to my first example. A
trajectory from zero to one. We can see that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.849
the velocity of the linear segment is a little
bit above 0.03. What we are going to do now

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.120
is to override the automatic choice of the
velocity of the linear segment. And, I'm going

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.329
to suggest that it use a value of 0.025 instead.
And, here we can see the trajectory is being

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.959
computed. You see that the linear segment
now is much longer and the parabolic blends

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:53.159
are much shorter. I am going to suggest that
it uses a slightly larger value of velocity

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.040
for the linear segment. And, now we can see
linear segment's quite short and the parabolic

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.029
blends are longer. The range of feasible values
for the velocity of the linear segment are

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:10.689
actually quite limited. And, if I suggest
a value of 0.02, it is returning an error indicating

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.570
that the velocity that I specified is too
small. It's not possible to compute a trapezoidal

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.239
profile with that value of velocity for the
linear segment.
