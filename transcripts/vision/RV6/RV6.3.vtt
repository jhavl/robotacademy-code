00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.470
We all started mixing colors when we were
very young, and we learned how to combine

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.559
different colors of paint to produce colors
that we wanted.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.170
For light the rules are a little bit different.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.020
If I shine a red light and a blue light, where
those two lights intersect I’m going to

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.010
have a sort of purply color.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.699
Where the red light intersects a green light,
where the red and green lights mix, I’m

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.220
going to form the color yellow.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.500
And where the green light and the blue light
overlap I’m going to form a color we might

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.550
call aqua.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.800
Where all three colors overlap we have white.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.770
If we consider these red, green and blue lights
as our primary light sources then by mixing

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.239
them in different combinations we can form
different colors.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.180
Here we’ve looked at just a few simple combinations.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.059
Let’s look at some more sophisticated combinations
of our red, green and blue primary colors.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.931
This table shows how we can create a number
of named colors from certain amounts of the

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.450
red, green and blue primaries.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.060
The numbers that are represented here are
our unsigned 8-bit integer numbers that we’ve

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.830
encountered previously, so they range between
0 and 255.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.530
So, for instance, if we wanted to create the
color called cadmium red deep, we’d need

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.860
a red amount of 227.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.170
So that’s a fair amount of red, given that
the maximum value is 255; only 23 of green

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.590
and 13 of blue.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.920
So this is a color that’s made up dominantly
of red.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.119
Let’s have a look at another color here
that’s perhaps a bit more balanced … let’s

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.180
look at hot pink.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.590
It contains the maximum possible amount of
red, and a fair amount of green and a fair

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020
amount of blue.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.270
So this is a palette.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.369
We can mix an arbitrary color from an arbitrary
amount of red, green and blue, and frequently

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.490
we’d like to give that color a human friendly
name.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.270
We can demonstrate color name lookup using
the toolbox function colorname.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.870
Let’s look up the definition of the color
maroon, and here we see the amount of red,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.480
green and blue required to create the color
maroon.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.209
These numbers here are what we call normalised
tri-stimulus values.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.730
That is, they lie between 0 and 1.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.340
So in this case, 0.4 in the red channel means
there’s 40% red, there’s only 2 % green,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.420
and perhaps 28 % blue.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.540
This function can perform the inverse function
as well.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.910
For instance, if I had a color that had 0.1
of red, 0.2 of green and 0.3 of blue, it’s

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.540
a fairly dark color and a bit bluish.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.370
It’s looking up and it’s telling me it’s
the color called midnight blue.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.520
This function has got a database file that
contains eight to nine hundred different colors.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.340
We could also use this mechanism to create
a color image, and to do that we need to pull

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.420
a little bit of a trick.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.489
So I’m going to create a single pixel image.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.930
Use the MATLAB function ones.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.890
I’m going to create an image with one row
and one column, and three planes.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.830
And it looks something like this.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:26.879
To set the pixel, I’m going to set row 1,
column 1, and all planes to the color of maroon.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.580
So there it is, I’ve created a single pixel
image, and if I display that now, I have my

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.010
single pixel image, a big solid block of maroon.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.150
A very common way of visualising the way we
mix red, green and blue primaries is what

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.049
we call the color cube.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.940
So imagine that we have a three dimensional
coordinate system.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.940
Three axes: a red axis, a green axis and a
blue axis.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.019
We’re going to introduce here the color
cube, and what we see here in this corner

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.940
is when we have the maximum amount of red
but no blue or no green, and we see, as you

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.909
would expect, red.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.110
Up here, where we have the maximum amount
of blue but no red or no green, we have the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.610
color blue.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.360
This corner we have maximum green, no red,
no blue.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.239
We see the color green.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.880
There is a file in the toolbox that allows
us to display the color cube: the function

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.389
is called rgbcube.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.810
And here it is.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.070
Now this is a three dimensional structure
so we want to do a rotation with a mouse.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.000
I’m going to move up here and select the
3d rotate button, and I grab it with my mouse

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.270
and I can rotate it.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.770
So it is a three dimensional coordinate system,
and down here is the origin.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.900
This is where the amounts of red, green and
blue are all 0.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.720
So we can see this dark corner here, that’s
where there is 0 amount of red, green and

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720
blue.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.370
On the diagonally opposite corner we can see
where there is a maximum amount of red, green,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.120
and blue, and that’s the white corner.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.690
If we look at the different faces of this
cube, we can see that this face here is basically

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.120
looking at mixtures of red and blue.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.560
This face here is looking at mixtures of blue
and green.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.610
Of course, this is just the surface of the
cube.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.140
If we were able to look inside the cube we
would find an infinite number of colors in

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.990
there as well; colors that we can’t see
from the outside.
