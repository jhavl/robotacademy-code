00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.759
The most common type of Geometry is known
as Euclidean Geometry and it’s named after

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.119
Euclid of Alexandria and he was a Greek who
lived a long time ago in Egypt.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.159
Around 300 BC, he wrote a very, very famous book. In
fact, a set of 13 books. It was called The

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:25.400
Elements. And, this is the basis of the Geometry
that you learned when you were at school.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.009
It’s the Geometry of things in a plane and
of things in three-dimensional space. It’s

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.809
Geometry about lines and triangles and circles.
It’s based on a few axioms, if you like

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.309
fundamental underlying principles. And, from
these few axioms, all the other principles

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.870
of Geometry can be derived. Importantly, there
are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry. We have

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.749
lines. We have letters. We talk about parallel
lines and we talk about right angles, but

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.390
there are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry
and there are no coordinate frames either.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.300
Rene Descartes was a very, very famous thinker
in the 17th Century. He was a philosopher.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.800
He was a mathematician and he was even a part
time mercenary in his younger days. He’s

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.050
often referred to as the Father of Modern
Philosophy and he was particularly famous

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.500
for the translation from the original Latin
of this quote, “I think, therefore I am.”

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.450
There are many stories about Descartes’
life. One that I particularly like is the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.190
fact that he found that was very, very useful
to lay in bed all through the morning and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.730
think. It was his thinking time. And, it’s
a really great principle.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.070
One morning, he was lying in bed, looking
at the wall, and a fly came in, and it landed

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.300
on the wall. And, he realized that he would
be able to describe the position of the fly

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.100
simply in terms of two numbers. So wherever
the fly was on the wall, it could be described

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.930
very succinctly using just two numbers. And,
this is the basis of the Cartesian coordinate

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.310
frame where we represent the position of something
in the plane using two coordinates, two numbers.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.780
So, the very important thing that Descartes
did was he added Algebra to Euclidean Geometry.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.450
And, that allowed us then to express shapes
in terms of equations. We can express lines

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.060
in terms of equation. We have the equations
for two lines. We can work out how they intersect

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.270
and what angle they intersect. It’s the
fusion of Algebra with the ancient Geometry.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.840
We refer to this as Cartesian Geometry or
Analytic Geometry. It’s called Cartesian.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.720
That’s derived from his name in Latin which
was Cartesius. So, he is the one who developed

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.970
the coordinate system, a very, very familiar
concept to us today, but it dates back to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.420
only the 17th Century. So, let’s look at
a 2D coordinate frame. We have a pair of axes.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.870
Each of these is a real number line and they
intersect at a point that we refer to as the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.569
origin. So, two axes form a 2D coordinate
frame, an x-axis and a y-axis. Now, let’s

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.300
describe a point using this two-dimensional
coordinate frame. In order to do that, we

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.660
drop a line down to the x-axis and its distance
from the origin we refer to by the quantity

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.620
a. And, we drop another line across to the
y-axis and the distance along the y-axis from

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.390
the origin we refer to as the distance b.
So, the point P can be described very succinctly

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.550
using a pair of numbers and we write them
in brackets just like that.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.840
A mathematician would say that a point is
a location in an n-dimensional space. We would

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.020
say that the point P is an element of, or belongs
to, the set of real numbers to the power of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.890
n. In this case, it would be R squared. We
can represent the point by a Cartesian coordinate.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.670
We can also refer to it as an n-tuple. That’s
a group of n numbers. We number them from

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.840
x1, x2, all the way up to xn. Again, in the
simple two-dimensional case, n is simply equal

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.599
to 2. We can think of a vector as an arrow
from the origin of our coordinate frame to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.500
the point of interest. And, we denote vectors
by lower case letters. Points by upper case

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.890
letters, vectors by lower case letters. In
this case, lower case p.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.580
A vector has got two components. A horizontal
component of length a, and a vertical component

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.859
of length b. We write the vector p differently
to the way we write the point P. We write

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.490
it as a vector. That’s a stack of numbers,
one above the other. In this case, a above

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.770
b. So, it’s a two element vector. It’s
also the same as a 2 by 1 matrix.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.010
That’s a matrix with two rows and one column.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.330
A mathematician would say that a vector is an element of an

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.830
n-dimensional vector space and we'd write
that as lower case p is an element of or belongs

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.749
to the set of real numbers to the power of
n. Once again, in this simple case, n is equal

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.620
to 2 because it’s a two-dimensional coordinate
frame. We can represent our vector, our arrow

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.659
on the coordinate frame, as a mathematical
n vector, a vector with two elements. And

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.669
so, that’s the elements x1, x2, all the
way up to xn and we apply the transpose operator.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.909
Here, I’ve written the vector as a row vector.
The elements are next to each other horizontally.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.650
When I transpose it, it becomes a column vector,
the elements one above the other, and this

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.319
will become important later, when we start
to multiply matrices and vectors together.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.759
We can also consider that a vector is a relative
displacement. It talks about a motion. How

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.729
do we get from the origin to the point P?
How do we get there? Well, we follow the path

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.080
which is this vector, this arrow. Another
important consideration is that this vector

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.339
has a particular starting point. And so, we
refer to this as a bound vector. So, this

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.370
vector here shown in red is different to this
vector here. Although they’ve got the same

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.849
length and they’ve got the same angle, they
are different vectors. Important to keep in

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.710
mind that in this course, all of our vectors
are bound. They have a particular starting

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.659
point. They’re defined with respect to a
particular coordinate frame.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.819
Another way we can express this vector, lower
case p, is in terms of unit vectors. So, let’s

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.360
define two unit vectors. These are vectors
with a length of 1 and I denote those with

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.909
a hat symbol on top. So, we have the unit
vector x hat and the unit vector y hat. Now,

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:24.210
I can express my vector in terms of two components.
One component is the distance a multiplied

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.830
by the unit vector x hat, plus another vector,
a vertical vector, which is the distance b

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.400
multiplied by the unit vector y hat. So, this
is a component representation of a vector

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.270
and we’ll be using this notation later on
in this lecture.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.129
Importantly, points and vectors are different
things. A point defines a location. We can’t

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.759
add two points together. It makes no sense.
And, neither can we multiply two points. It’s

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.680
a meaningless concept. Vectors don’t define
a location. They specify how to get from one

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.879
location to another. Vectors are things that
we can add and we can subtract. And, we can

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:11.259
multiply a vector by a scalar. I can have
a vector; I could multiply it by 2. Now, I

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.789
have an arrow that’s twice as long but in
the same direction and with the same beginning

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:21.319
as the vector that I had before. The difference
between two points is a vector. So, I can

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.710
take the difference between two points and
the result is no longer a point, the result

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.339
is now a vector. And, similarly, I can define
a point in terms of a vector displacement

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:38.029
from an initial point. So for the two-dimensional
case, a point is represented by two real numbers

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:43.339
and a vector is also represented by two real
numbers. But, points and vectors are different

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.539
things.
We need to be careful when we create a coordinate

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:52.300
frame. This is the standard way. It’s referred
to as a right-handed coordinate frame. And,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.449
we swing from the x-axis through 90 degrees
up to the y-axis. And, here is another example

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.960
of a right-handed coordinate frame. If we
were to flip the frame upside down, we now

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.249
have the x-axis in this direction and the
y-axis down. So, we would swing this in 90

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:16.169
degrees downwards in order to define the y-axis.
Now, we need to be very consistent in the

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:20.830
way we define the coordinate frames and we’re
always going to use a right-handed coordinate

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.599
frame. We will never use a coordinate frame
like this, only frames that look like this.

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:30.639
When we construct a two-dimensional coordinate
frame from two axes, there are in fact two

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.979
different ways that we can construct that
coordinate frame. A so called left-handed

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:40.050
coordinate frame and a right-handed coordinate
frame. Now, in this course, we’re only going

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.240
to deal with right-handed coordinate frames.
So, how do we construct a right-handed coordinate

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.529
frame? Well, we start by drawing the x-axis
first and the y-axis is created by swinging

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:58.339
the x-axis 90 degrees in the counterclockwise
direction. That gives us a right-handed coordinate

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:02.949
frame. So, no matter what the orientation
of the coordinate frame, the relative orientation

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:08.829
of the x and y axes is really critical and
it must follow this convention. Another important

00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:15.040
thing to keep in mind is that Euclidean Geometry
only applies to planes. And, one of Euclid’s

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.949
postulates or axioms is very, very clear about
this, and that is that parallel lines never

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:23.180
intersect and that is, of course, the case
on a plane.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.910
However, on something like sphere, for instance,
the surface of our planet, this no longer

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:34.440
holds true. Parallel lines at the equator
will intersect at the poles. The rules of

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.959
Euclidean Geometry do not apply on such a
surface, but we would say that the surface

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:46.959
of the Earth leads to a non-Euclidean Geometry.
However, over a small area, the Euclidean

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:51.959
Geometry is a very good approximation. So,
over the scale of a room, maybe even over

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:56.689
the scale of a city, Euclidean Geometry - the
fact that parallel lines don’t intersect

00:09:56.689 --> 00:09:59.509
- is a pretty good assumption to make.
