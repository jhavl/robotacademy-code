00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.799
In the previous lecture, we looked at the
tooltip velocity for a two-joint robot. The

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.740
end-effector pose is described by the end-effector
coordinates x and y, and we came up with expressions

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.890
for the rate of change of the end-effector
pose. That is the rate of change of x and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.939
the rate of change of y in terms of the rate
of change of the robot joint angles. We did

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.390
a similar thing for the three-joint robot
where the end-effector pose is described by

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.420
a coordinate x and y, and an orientation angle,
theta. And, we again described x-dot, y-dot

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.829
and theta-dot in terms of the rate of change
of the robot’s joint angles.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.840
Now, we want to do the same thing for a six-axis
robot like this Puma 560 robot. We found out

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.579
that it is very, very difficult to do. The
necessary differential calculus and algebra

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.370
is going to take up pages and pages and pages
in my notebook. It is a very difficult thing

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.140
to do. So, we are going to look at an alternative
way to crack this problem.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.430
So, what we want do now is to understand the
relationship between the velocity of the joints

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.860
of this multi-jointed robot and the velocity
of the end-effector, which we described in

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.350
terms of its rate of change of its x, y and
z coordinates and rate of change of its orientation.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.820
If we look at just a single joint, which
is the approach we are going to use here,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.810
we can see that as I adjust just the first
joint of the robot, we can see that the end-effector

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.670
moves in an arc. And so, as I adjust joint
one by a small amount, we see that the x and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.840
y coordinates of the end-effector change.
Now, if I adjust the second joint by a small

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.860
amount, we can see that the end-effector changes
in the vertical or z direction and its orientation

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.670
also changes slightly. We can follow exactly
the same argument for the third joint of the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.259
robot, fourth joint of the robot and so on.
In your first calculus class, you would have

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.040
come across this relationship. We can approximate
the derivative of a function by taking a finite

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.150
difference. In this case, we perturb the value
of x by a small amount, delta x. And, as delta

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.229
x gets smaller and smaller in the limit as
it approaches zero, we have the true derivative.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.620
What we are going to do is to compute an approximate
derivative of the forward kinematic function.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.780
Now, we have introduced previously the forward
kinematics as a function K and function of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.190
the joint angles and it returns the end-effector
pose. And, you will notice here that I have

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.590
used the partial derivative notation because
the kinematic function is a function of a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.849
vector Q. And, we are going to consider the
partial derivative with respect to one particular

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.069
joint angle. So, what we are trying to do
is to come up with an approximation for the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.910
way in which the forward kinematics changes
as a function of variation of a single joint

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.660
angle.
For the six-axis robot, we are going to treat

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.840
the joints individually and we are going to
start with joint number one. So, the first

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.260
thing that we are interested in is, if I adjust
joint number one, what effect does that have

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.660
on the translational and angular velocity
of the end-effector? In the animation on the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.030
right hand side, we can see the end-effector
pose changing as we make small adjustments

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.310
to the first joint angle. That is Q1.
Let us look at how this works for the Puma

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.500
560 robot. The first thing I am going to do
is to load a model of the Puma 560 robot and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.840
we need to decide what joint angle configuration
the robot is going to be in. You will notice

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.520
in the workspace that there are a number of
variables like Qn, Qr, Qs and Qz and these

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.530
are just different robot poses.
The one we are going to use is Qn. That is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.790
short hand for Q nominal. This is a pose of
the Puma robot that is somewhat in the middle

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.670
of its workspace and where it is very dexterous.
It is able to move nicely in many different

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.409
directions.
Now, we are going to do is to compute the

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:59.720
forward kinematics at that particular pose
and we use the fkine method to do that. And,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.159
here is the end-effector pose expressed as
a homogeneous transformation matrix. Now,

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:11.239
what I am going to do is to compute the end-effector
pose when I slightly disturb the joint angles.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.060
So, it is going to be about the pose Qn. What
I am going to do is to add a vector to that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.549
and the first element in the vector is a small
displacement.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.170
Now, I am going to displace joint one. So,
I am going to add zero to the rest of the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.449
robot’s joints. What we have now is the
end-effector pose for a very small change

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.500
in the angle of joint number one. We have
disturbed joint one by 0.01 radians. And

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.120
here, we can see that the end-effector pose
is slightly different.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.190
If we summarised the results that we have
just obtained in MATLAB for the nominal joint

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.610
angle given here by the vector Q, this is
the robot’s end-effector pose expressed

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.300
as a 4 x 4 homogenous transformation matrix.
We adjusted Q by a very small amount. We adjusted

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.090
it by 0.01 radians, which is around half
a degree. When we did that, we obtained a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.509
slightly different value for the robot’s
end-effector pose. We can see that the numbers

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.729
in those two matrices are not exactly the
same and that is, of course, what we expect

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.180
because we have changed one of the joint angles.
The challenge now is to understand how this

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.910
change is related to the change in the joint
angle.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.880
We are now going to use the expression we
introduced a moment ago which relates the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.169
derivative of a function to a finite difference
in a function. If I compute that finite difference,

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.350
I get this matrix result here. And the question
is, of course, what does this actually mean?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.500
If I write the symbolic expression for a homogeneous
transformation matrix, which we recall has

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.880
got a 3 x 3 rotational component and a 3 x
1 translational component, and if I take the

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.210
derivative of that matrix with respect to
the joint variable Q1, I can write this expression

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.050
here.
Now, we can match the components in this symbolic

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.920
expression with the components in the numeric
expression. So, this is the expression - a

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.789
partial derivative of T with respect to Q1
and this bit here is the partial derivative

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.319
of the rotation matrix with respect to Q1.
Let us consider first the translational part.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.370
Here is the partial derivative of the robot’s
end-effector position with respect to Q1.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.660
And, if I multiply that by the rate of change
of Q1 with respect to time, I end up with

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.009
the rate of change of translation with respect
to time, which is in fact is the end-effector’s

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.789
translational velocity. That is x-dot, y-dot
and z-dot which I might also write sometimes

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:43.370
as Vx, Vy or Vz. I can rearrange this expression
and we have an expression for the end-effector

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.180
velocity in terms of a constant vector multiplied
by the velocity of joint one.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.880
You notice that there is an approximation
sign in here. It is important to remember

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.100
that we have computed a finite difference
here. It is an approximation to the true derivative.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.289
We used a change in joint angle of 0.01 radians.
And, as we make that change in joint angle

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.960
smaller and smaller, we will get a better
approximation to the true derivative. But,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.860
if we make it too small, we will encounter
numerical errors because of the way arithmetic

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.979
is done inside a digital computer and we need
to find some sort of balance. So, keep in

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:24.319
mind that what we have done here is an approximation
to the true relationship.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.520
We have related end-effector translational
velocity to rate of change of Q1 and we can

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.699
do this for joint two and for joint three
all the way up to joint six. Find the expressions

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.530
that relate joint velocity to end-effector
translational velocity.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.880
Let us now consider the rotational part. And,
this is not quite as straightforward. Here,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.860
I have written the partial derivative of a
rotation matrix with respect to joint angle

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.920
one. And, if I multiply that by the rate of
change of joint one with respect to time,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.100
I end up with the rate of change of the rotation
matrix with respect to time. There is a well-known

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.419
relationship between the rate of change of
the rotation matrix, the angular velocity

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:09.099
omega and the rotation matrix itself. And,
we can substitute that in here. The matrix

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:14.240
S is what we called a skew symmetric matrix
and it is a function of the angular velocity

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.669
vector omega.
