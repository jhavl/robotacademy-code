00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.800
In the last couple of lectures, we've looked
at the process of image formation, that's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.320
how we transform the 3D world, into a two-dimensional
image or representation of that world. The

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.599
actual three-dimensional structure of the
world is really, really important, for animals

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.420
as well as for robots. So in the case of animals,
if you image that you are a predatory animal,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.870
it's really important to know how far away
the prey is. If you're a prey animal it's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.510
really important to know how far away the
predator is. If you're a robot, you might

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.520
want to know how far away is the object that
you want to reach and grab. If you're a mobile

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.670
robot, you want to know which parts of the
space in front of you have got objects sticking

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.789
up above the ground, that prevent you from
driving there and which parts of the world

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.550
are free from those kinds of obstacles.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.110
So we want to have a three dimensional structure
of the world, but we've only got a two dimensional

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.970
representational projection. How do we solve
this problem? When human beings look at a

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.549
two dimensional image or a photograph, we
imagine the three dimensional structure and

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.759
that comes from our experience of 3D worlds,
the experiences that we've gain through our

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.430
whole lives. And I'm going to talk a little
bit about some of the mechanism by which human

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.400
beings fill in this missing dimension. In
particular I'm going to talk about binocular

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.799
stereo and that's how we take information
from two cameras, like the two eyes that we

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.549
have in our heads and recreate three dimensional
world from that. And this is a very common

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.100
technique in robotics called "Stereo Vision".
