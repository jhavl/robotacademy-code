00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.050
We might take some inspiration for how human
beings solve this problem; we're very good

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.370
at understanding and operating in the three
dimensional world. In fact human beings use

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.289
a large number of different techniques, tricks,
sometimes called visual cues, to understand

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.010
three-dimensional structure.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.420
Nine of them have been identified in this
particular paper. Different cues operate in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.929
different distance regimes. Thought there
are some that are effective within our arms

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.489
reach, some are effective up to tens of meters
and some are effective right out to the horizon,

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.379
a distance of many kilometres.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.280
Let's have a look at some of these visual
cues. The simplest of all is occlusion, and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.250
this information comes from what object is
in front of another object. We can tell here

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.329
that the cat is in front of the brick gatepost
because the cat blocks out of obscures some

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.309
of that gatepost and the flowers are in front
of the cat because they block out some of the cat.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.549
Another important cue is height in the visual
field. Looking at this we can see a tree and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.450
we know a tree's a pretty big thing. But in
this particular image the tree does not look

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.170
that big, so therefore we figure that the
tree must be a long way away.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.570
We also have relative size. Here we have a
number of trees. In our brain there's probably

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.070
some sort of logic that says that these are
trees, trees are all going to be the same

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.130
size, so therefore, this tree which looks
bigger than the other tree must be closest to us.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.340
In these eye catching pictures, our brain
is momentarily confused. It takes a moment

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.210
for us to figure out what are the small things
that are close to the camera and what are

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.409
the large things that are far away from the
camera.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.869
Here's a picture of a large stone in the desert
and just looking at it, it's rather hard for

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.340
us to gauge in any sort of absolute way, how
big this stone is and we can break the illusion

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840
by introducing something who's size we know;
a pair of fingers and we can pick this stone

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.439
up and we can compare it to its more famous
big brother, the largest stone in the world,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.619
called Uluru in the centre of Australia.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.980
Here we see a very, very powerful illusion.
But nothing about this room is, as it seems.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.080
For a start the floor is not flat. Now follow
me in and see what it looks like from the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.910
inside. The clock is not actually round; if
we look at those square floor tiles we see

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.980
that they are not actually square. And the
corners of the room are not right angles.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.500
The whole geometry of the room has been contrived,
so that from this one particular viewpoint

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
it looks like an ordinary room.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.690
Another technique we use to estimate distance
is called "Texture Density" and a good example

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.410
of it is seen here in this gravel path. Up
close we can see the individual pieces of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.290
gravel and at increasing distance the pieces
of gravel get smaller and smaller in the image.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.989
Up close the texture is quite coarse and as
we go further away the texture becomes finer

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.090
and finer, so in our eyes and our brain, we're
looking at the size of a texture and making

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.269
some assumptions about how that relates to
distance.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.980
A technique that we use over very, very large
distances is called aerial perspective. This

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.610
exploits the fact that objects that are at
large distances of the order of kilometres,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.860
become less distinct; more hazy.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.769
A really important cue is binocular disparity
and we're going to talk much more about it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.819
in this lecture. This is the information thatâ€™s
derived from two views of the scene from two

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.930
different viewpoints; our left eye and our
right eye and it's a technique that is very,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.459
very widely used in animals.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.299
Our eye contains a lens and is a fairly autonomous
part of our brain is responsible for keeping

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.650
that lens focused, so if we're looking at
something that's up close, this part of our

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.629
brain is going to adjust the shape of the
lens so that we can focus on that object.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.169
If the object is further away, then the shape
of the lens is going to be changed to focus on that.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.159
We can take information from this muscle and
use that as a proxy for the distance of the

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.199
object. There is another fairly autonomous
part of our visual system, which is responsible

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.720
for controlling direction in which our eyes
point. When an object is close to our face,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.979
our eyes converge on that particular object.
If we take information about the direction

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.499
that are eyes are pointing, we can triangulate to the object and that is a way of inferring its distance.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.240
The final technique that we use is called
"Motion Perspective" and that is as I'm moving

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.290
through the world, objects that are close
to me, appear to be moving quite quickly,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.930
whereas objects that are far away, appear
to move much more slowly.
