Welcome to the last lecture in the Robotic
Vision course and thanks for hanging in there.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.869
We've talked a lot about the way that images
are formed, how we transform the three-dimensional

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.219
world into a two dimensional image. And an
underlying assumption in all of that has been

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.200
that the camera is stationary and the object
is stationary.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.980
Well now we're going to consider the case
where the camera is moving. The first thing

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.930
we're going to look at then is how does the
image change as the camera moves through space.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.149
And then we're going to flip it around and
say, let's say that I've got an image of something

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.350
that looks like this in the image and I want
it to look like this in the image. What we're

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.539
going to try to work out is how should the
camera move in order to change the image from

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.859
this to this.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.830
The camera has to change its viewpoint and
so we want to work out directly how the camera

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.909
should move in order to make that happen.
This is a technique called "Vision Based Control"

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.900
sometimes called "Visual Servoing" and is
a topic that I've spent a good deal of my

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.180
life thinking about.
