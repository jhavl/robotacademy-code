00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
Different types of camera

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.990
So far we've just considered the case of perspective
projection. It's the sort of image that is formed

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.070
by a simple lens and the same sort of optics
as we have in our own eyes. But there are

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.840
many many different sorts of cameras and different
sorts of lenses.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.529
They don't necessarily perform perspective
projection. In this particular case, we're

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.099
looking at a fish eye lens image. A fish eye
lens here has got a very very wide field of

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.899
view. If we look at the image captured by
the fish eye lens, we notice a few things.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.410
Most importantly we note that the straightness
of line is not preserved. So we see on top

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.910
of the laptop on the side of the coke can,
these are no longer straight lines. They appear

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.570
to be curves because this is not a perspective
projection. Lenses work by refraction.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.050
That is they bend the rays of light that are passing through them.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.280
Another way we can do this is by reflection.
We use curved mirrors instead of lenses in

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.470
order to bend the light rays. Here is an
example again from the drawings of Isaac

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.150
Newton of his early reflecting telescope.
Sometimes very very big lenses are actually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.759
made by combinations of shaped mirrors and
lenses.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.549
These sort of hybrid imaging systems are referred
to as catadioptrics. This is derived from

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.750
the Greek word dioptrics for refraction and
catoptrics for reflection.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.570
Another type of imaging system again on this
catadioptric model is a panoramic lens. You

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.950
can see it quite clearly here. What we have
down the bottom is a fairly standard camera

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.829
with a lens in front of it. And then there
is a stalk which holds a parabolic mirror.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.369
So the camera is actually looking at the parabolic
mirror.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.340
This arrangement allows us to create panoramas.
So the raw panorama, what the camera actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.490
sees, is shown here on the bottom right. We
see a very very distorted view of the world.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.069
Because we know the mathematics of this image
formation process we can unwrap the image

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.330
and that is what we use to create the panorama
shown at the top.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.890
What we note with this panoramic image once
again is that straight lines are not preserved.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.260
They appear to be very very seriously distorted.
