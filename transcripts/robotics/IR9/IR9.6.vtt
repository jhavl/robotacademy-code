00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.270
There is a lot of really rich information
in the Jacobian matrix and we can use it as

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.950
a sort of diagnostic tool to work at how well the robot can move at a particular joint angle configuration.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.760
Let us look in more detail at the case where
the Jacobian matrix is singular and this is

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.060
what the Jacobian matrix looks like for a
robot in the pose shown here, where joint

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.360
angle five is equal to zero. The motion of
the end-effector due to joint four is given

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.660
by this column of the Jacobian matrix and
the motion of the end-effector due to joint

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.280
six is given by this column of the Jacobian
matrix.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.650
You will notice that these two columns are
identical and that means that they result

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.800
in the same end-effector motion and in this
particular case it is rotation about the world

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.230
Z axis. We can get the same motion by changing
joint four or by changing joint six.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.810
For a square matrix, if two columns are identical,
then it becomes singular; and a mathematician

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.050
would say that the rank of the matrix has
reduced from full rank, rank six, to a rank of five.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.660
Here is that same Jacobian matrix in MATLAB
and we can clearly see that columns four and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.040
column six are identical. If we compute the
determinate of the matrix, we see that it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.040
is equal to zero; it means that this Jacobian
is singular. If I compute the rank of this

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.540
matrix, it is equal to five and thatâ€™s saying
that there are only five unique columns in

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.960
this matrix. Two of the columns are identically
equal.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.200
Let us look now at a more healthy Jacobian
matrix. We are going to compute the Jacobian

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.720
for the set joint angle Qn. This matrix has
no obvious duplicated columns. Its determinant

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.940
is not equal to zero and its rank is equal
to six. That means that all six columns are unique.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.940
In the last lecture, we introduced the concept
of the velocity ellipse and we did this in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.640
two dimensions. For a set of joint angles
which lie on a circle in the plane of all

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.159
possible joint angle velocities, we mapped
that into an ellipse in the space of all possible

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.950
end-effector velocities and that indicated
that in a particular robot joint angle configuration,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.450
the robot was able to move more quickly in
the world Y direction than it could move in

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.560
the world X direction. We can do the same
thing for a six-axis robot, but the mathematics

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.040
is a little bit more complex.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.760
We have this relationship between the robot
end-effector spatial velocity and the joint

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.980
angle velocity. I can combine these two equations
and come up with this expression which is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.900
the equation for a hyper-ellipsoid or some
ellipse in six dimensions; so it is a little

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.209
hard to get your head around. Mostly, we
are interested in the first three elements

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.340
of the spatial velocity; that is the translational
velocity of the robot end-effector.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.969
In this case, we end up with a three-dimensional
ellipsoid which we can quite easily plot. So,

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.290
here is the velocity ellipsoid for a robot
in a particular configuration. We could view

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.290
this ellipsoid from different angles and we
could see that the ellipse is quite elongated

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.029
in the vertical direction and it is reasonably
flat in the direction towards the base of

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:21.379
the robot and so the robot is able to move
most quickly in the direction of the long

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.019
axis of the ellipse and it moves much more
slowly in the direction of the short axis

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.749
of this ellipsoid.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.439
If the ellipsoid was actually a sphere, then
we say the motion is isotropic; that means

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.120
that the robot end-effector is able to move
equally quickly in any direction. It is convenient

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.999
to introduce a notion of manipulability, a difficult
word to say, and it is a simple scalar measure

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:49.370
that says something about the shape of the
velocity ellipsoid. If manipulability is equal

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.889
to one, then we have the case of isotropic
motion; the robot is able to move equally

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.439
fast in any direction.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.609
If manipulability is equal to zero, then the
ellipsoid is collapsed and it becomes just

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.959
an elliptical plate and it means that motion
in one Cartesian direction is not possible

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.739
at all. In general, the manipulability will
be somewhere between zero and one. If it is

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.559
close to one, it means that the robot is configured
to move quite quickly in any direction in its workspace.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.400
As the manipulability gets closer to zero,
it means that the robot is in an awkward pose

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.300
and there are some directions where it was
not able to move very quickly at all. Manipulability

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.720
is a strong function of the robot joint angles,
so depending on the task, you may need to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.980
set the robot joint angles so that it has got the speed required in order to achieve that particular task.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.820
We are going to use MATLAB to display one
of these velocity ellipsoids. The first thing

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.430
I am going to do is to plot the robot in the
joint angle configuration that is in the middle

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.970
of its work-space and that is what the robot
looks like and then I am going to use the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.970
method for ellipse to overlay on that a velocity
ellipsoid.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.820
This method has got quite a number of arguments
and options. First of all, I pass in the joint

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.360
angles that I am interested in. I want the
ellipse to be plotted in the colour blue and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.800
I want the edge lines on the ellipse to be
in white. I want the whole thing to

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.470
be somewhat translucent, so I am going to
give it an alpha value of 0.5 and there we

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.760
see the velocity ellipse.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.190
Now, I can rotate this around and look at
it from all sorts of different orientations

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.640
and viewpoints. If I look at it pretty much
side on, we can see that the ellipse is relatively

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.920
thin in the direction toward the base of the
robot. That is the direction where the robot

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.240
is not able to move very quickly or as in
the vertical Z direction, basically up and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.050
down, the robot is able to move quite quickly;
so that is the velocity ellipsoid for this

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.470
joint angle configuration.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.710
If I choose a different joint angle configuration,
this is where the robot arm is stretched right

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.250
out horizontally which is the joint angle
vector, Qs, in my workspace then the robot

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.970
is in that configuration and now I am going
to plot the ellipse for this particular configuration,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.340
so I would just come back and edit this command,
change Qn to Qs, and here we have the velocity

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.220
ellipsoid for this particular case.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.970
Now, we can see that it is an ellipse; but
side on, it has got no thickness at all, it

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.700
is a plate. So, in this particular joint angle
configuration, the robot is able to move its

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.710
end-effector from this particular view up
and down and left and right; but looking it

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.710
at this way, it has got no ability at all
to move the end-effector back towards the base.
