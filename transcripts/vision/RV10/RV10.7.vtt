00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.820
I'd like to finish off by sharing with you
two quite amazing research videos they both

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.150
show the power of combining visual information
taken from multiple viewpoints.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.480
The first is a system that draws large depositories
of photographs, for instance, Flickr. In this

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.150
case they retrieve a whole lot of images taken
of Rome.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.430
All of these images taken by different people
at different times clearly have a lot of overlap.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.880
What they do is they find the same points
in multiple images and from that then, they

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.800
can then reconstruct the relative precision
of the cameras that took those pictures.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.559
Then they can combine this information across
hundreds or even thousands of pictures and

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.320
use that to reconstruct a full three-dimensional
model.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.879
They didn't have to go and visit, they just
mined the web for photographs that were already

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.539
there, and with some very clever algorithms
were able to extract from all those pictures,

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.780
this three dimensional model.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.400
This next one extends the technique to combine
information from millions and millions of

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.120
images taken by different people with different cameras at different times but of the same subject matter.
