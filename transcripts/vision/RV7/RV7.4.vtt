00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.490
One problem with pinhole cameras, is that
the images that they create are very, very

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
dim and that's one of the reasons that they
are so hard to capture and the reason that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
the images are dim, is if we look at all the
light rays that emerge from a particular point,

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
in this example, only one of those light rays
goes through and forms the image, the rest

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.050
of the light rays hit the opaque plane and
are absorbed or reflected off to somewhere else.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.439
 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.500
So if we want to make our image brighter we
need to be able to utilize more of the light

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.989
rays that are leaving the object and the way
we do that, is to use a lens.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.239
A lens is a very simple technique for gathering
more of the light rays that leave a particular

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.840
point in the world. Again we have our graphical
example and we can see the light rays leaving

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.539
one particular point, they've all passed through
the lens and strike the image plane. So here

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.870
we've captured many, many more light rays,
so the image that we form will be brighter.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.920
We can describe this a bit more formally.
We consider the distance away from the lens

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.510
plane which we will call the distance F and
the diameter of the lens which is the distance

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.530
Phi and we can create a number, which is generally
referred to as the F number of the lens, which

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.409
is the ratio of F to Phi. The F number of
the lens is typically inscribed on the front

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.130
of the lens; in this case it's a F1.4 lens
so that means capital F equals 1.4. The smaller

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.470
the F number the greater is the light gathering
power of the lens, the brighter image that

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.150
it will create. Let's simplify things and
see how lenses work.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.369
We have a simple object in the world and we
have a lens. And a lens is described by a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.390
focal length and in this case we have what
we call a thin lens model. This is probably

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.009
familiar to you from high school physics.
The real lenses that you have in your camera

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.020
are not simple lenses like this, but they
can be approximated by a single lens.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.810
The lens is described by two focal points,
each a distance F away from the centre plane

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.829
of the lens. To see where the image of the
object falls, we perform this very simple

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.480
geometry and the small arrow shows where the
image will be formed. It's the intersection

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.590
of the two yellow lines. This image formation
process is described quite simply mathematically,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.020
the distance of the object which we call "Zo"
the distance at which the image is formed

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.340
"Zi" is related by this equation here, so
Zi is the distance away from the centre of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.599
the lens, where a sharp image will be formed
and that's what we call the "Image Plane."

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.340
That's where the image is formed and that's
where we put the sensor. Now the sensor might

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.849
have been a piece of film in the old days,
today it's much more likely that we place

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.500
a semiconductor imaging chip; a large array
of light sensitive elements and the output

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.410
of this array is recorded digitally and placed
into the flash memory in the phone or the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.200
camera.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.030
Now let's look at what happens if I move the
object a little bit closer to the lens. The

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.040
value of Zo has been reduced and we do the
geometric construction, we see now that the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.060
image is formed in a different place; Zi has
got a different value, as given by the equation

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.430
down the bottom. What this means is that if
I had the image plane in the original location,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
I would have a fuzzy image there; that image
would be out of focus.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.069
In order to create a focussed image, I need
to move the image plane over to here and if

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.010
I place the image plane there, then I will
have a sharp image of my object. And so this

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.110
is what happens when I adjust the focus of
an old fashioned type camera. As I rotate

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.920
the lens in order to focus it, there's a screw
thread there which is actually moving the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.280
lens away from the plane of the sensor or
the film. So in order to focus a camera, what

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.299
I need to do is to change the distance between
the lens and the plane where the image is

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.360
formed and captured.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.430
Here's an animation that shows this. As the
object moves towards the lens, we can see,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.260
just using the simple geometric construction,
that the location of the image is moving further

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.799
and further away from the lens, so in order
to bring it into focus, I need to move the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.830
image plane away from the lens.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.280
Interestingly a pinhole camera does not require
focussing. Irrespective of the distance of

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.729
the object, the image that it forms is always
sharp, but the disadvantage of the pinhole

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.250
lens as I mentioned earlier, is that the images
are very, very faint. So it doesn't need focussing

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.210
but it doesn't produce bright images.
