00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.680
Before we start talking about robotic vision,
it’s going to be very useful just to revisit

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.259
some fundamentals of robots, and in particular,
definitions of what a robot is.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.720
For those of you who participated in the first
online course, we presented this definition

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.029
of what a robot is: It’s a goal-oriented
machine that can sense, plan and act. And

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.210
the important keywords are highlighted here
in red.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.619
A more casual definition that we introduced
for a robot is that it’s a machine that

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.340
can move—either itself or perhaps its hand—from
place A to place B. So we might move its hand

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.330
to pick up an object at place A, and put it
down at place B; or it might move its entire

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.180
body. It might move along a corridor from
place A in the corridor to place B in the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.040
corridor.
Let’s now look at some of the keywords in

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.850
the first, more detailed definition, and one
of the key concepts is sensing.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.580
A robot fundamentally is a machine that can
sense its environment. The sorts of things

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.119
that it might want to sense is: where is the
object that it needs to manipulate—where

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.659
is the thing that it needs to pick up. Another
thing that it might want to sense is where

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.840
is the robot itself. A mobile robot in a corridor
situation; whereabouts in the corridor is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.930
the robot? This is the classical ‘where
am I?’ problem of mobile robotics.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.890
Another thing a robot needs to do is to plan.
So from its sensors it knows where it is;

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.081
it knows where the things that it needs to
work with are; it has got a goal, a thing

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.909
that it wants to achieve. So it makes a plan
of where to move from its current state to

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.140
its goal state.
And the final part of the process is to carry

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.659
out some action. Given that I’ve got a plan,
now I have to carry out the step of the plan.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.459
I grab the object or I move myself from place
A to place B.
