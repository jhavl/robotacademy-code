00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.990
Welcome to week 3 in the Robotic Vision Project.
The objective for this week is to get our

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.150
image of our robot vision worksheet in MATLAB
and then, segment the particular 2D shapes

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.390
into a color that being either red, green
or blue. I've written a function in MATLAB

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.699
that allows me to do this so let's take a
look at the outputs of this week in our MATLAB.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:28.939
Okay, so in MATLAB here, I already have the
robotic vision worksheet loaded so let's take

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:29.939
a look at that quickly.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.739
Okay, so the robotic vision worksheet is here
as you can see and the task this week is to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.770
take the image I have here and then, segment
it according to the particular color channel

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.850
that you're interested in.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.980
So, that will allow you to specify what 2D
objects they want to appear in your image.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.129
So, you either want to get the red 2D objects
or the green 2D objects or the blue 2D objects.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.670
So, the output is going to be a thresholded
or binary image of what you started with.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.220
Now, I've written a function that allows me
to do that and I've called it getColor. So,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.810
let's see how my getColor function works.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.000
So, let's say I wanted to segment the red
2D objects using my function. How would I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
do that?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.390
Well, I need to make a new variable and I'll
call it R2D and then, I'll call my function

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.600
which is getColor and my particular function
takes in 2 variables.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.720
The first is the robotic vision worksheet
which is img and the second parameter is a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.860
color so I can specify either red, green or
blue to segment the particular 2D objects

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.640
of that I'm interested in and you can see
that that is produced a R2D variable on the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.479
side here and it is logical.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.869
So, it's a binary or logical image. So, let's
take a look at what that looks like. So I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.890
will call, idisp(r2d) and then, I can have
both of these images up the same time.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.540
So, you can see on the left hand side, we
have our original robotic vision worksheet

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.140
and on the right, this is my segmented image
and you can see that only the red 2D objects

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.140
are highlighted.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.170
Okay, so it's a binary image. We either only
have black or white on here and the white

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290
are the red 2D objects.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.050
So, this is a task for you guys to do this
week: Create a function similar to my getColor

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.680
function that allows you to produce a segmented
binary image of a particular color channel

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680
that you're interested in.
