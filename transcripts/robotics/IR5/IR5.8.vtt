00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.330
Let's summarize some of the points that we’ve
talked about in this lecture.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.410
Today we take for granted that we can use
GPS to determine our position anywhere on

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.179
the surface of the planet, but it is a relatively
recent technology. It only became operational

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:25.439
in 1994, and only became available at reasonable
accuracy for the general public in the year 2000.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.359
Before the advent of GPS, navigating precisely
on the surface of the planet or in outer space

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.679
was very very difficult, and the technology
that was used was called inertial navigation,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.489
and that involved measuring the acceleration
and angular velocity of a vehicle, and integrating

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.510
that over time to determine the position.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.350
The key components of an Inertial Navigation
System are: an inertial measurement unit;

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.260
which contains the sensors that measure acceleration,
magnetic field, and angular velocity, and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.320
what’s called dead reckoning software; that
takes those signals and integrates them over

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.309
time to continually update the pose of the
vehicle.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.360
At a simplistic level we can consider that
an accelerometer is a mass on a spring inside

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.299
a little box. If we do the algebra we can
show that the extension of the spring is linearly

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.770
proportional to the acceleration of the device
and the gravitational acceleration. An accelerometer

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.680
at rest on earth indicates an acceleration
of 1g in the vertical or upward direction.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.759
This is a little bit counter-intuitive, because
when we drop something it is going to accelerate

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.159
in the downward direction. The accelerometer
at rest measures 1g upwards. And this is a

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.259
consequence of the equivalence principle.
An accelerometer on the surface of the earth

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.610
or an accelerometer mounted in a rocket accelerating
upwards at 1g, both of them indicate an acceleration

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.180
of 1g.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.369
Many devices, for example my phone, contain
three accelerometers which measure acceleration

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.890
in the x, y and z directions of a coordinate
frame B attached to my phone. I can use the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.960
components of acceleration measured in the
phone in coordinate frame B to determine the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.030
roll and pitch of the phone with respect to
the blue coordinate frame 0.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.940
The earth contains a gigantic but fairly weak
magnet, but the poles of that magnet are not

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.700
constant. They change with time. A compass
has a needle which points towards the north

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800
magnetic pole, but the north magnetic pole
is different to the north geographic pole.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.480
At any particular point on the surface of
the earth we can establish a right-handed

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.920
coordinate frame where one axis points towards
the north geographic pole, another axis points

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.000
vertically downwards towards the centre of
the planet, and the other axis points in the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.690
geographic east direction. The earth’s magnetic
field vector is shown here by a red arrow,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.660
and it can be described with respect to this
coordinate frame by two angles. Magnetic declination

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.800
is the difference between two directions;
the direction of true north and the direction

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.880
of magnetic north - the direction that the
compass points in. The other angle is magnetic

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
inclination, and that’s the angle that the
magnetic field vector makes with respect to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.260
a local horizontal surface. It’s also referred
to as magnetic dip.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.130
In order to determine the yaw angle - that’s
the direction that the body is facing with

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.150
respect to magnetic north - we need to combine
information from two sensors. We determine

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.350
the roll and pitch angle of the body using
the accelerometers, and then we use the components

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.080
of the magnetic field sensed onboard the body,
combine that with what we know about the local

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.440
magnetic inclination angle, and the local
magnetic field strength to determine the yaw

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.270
angle.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.170
A spinning disc has some interesting dynamic
properties. One of these is that we can use

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.490
it to convert an angular velocity - omega
- about the blue axis, into a torque - tau

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.770
- about the red axis.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.160
We can measure that torque by measuring the
forces that are exerted on the axle that supports

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.210
the rotating disc. If we know the parameters
such as the rotational inertia of the disc

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.040
and the rotational velocity of the disc, then
we can determine omega, the rotational velocity

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.080
of this gyroscopic sensor.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.160
Interestingly there are biological equivalents
of accelerometers and gyroscopes in our bodies.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.660
In each of our ears we have two accelerometers
and three gyroscopes which measure the motion

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.410
of our body, and that’s integrated with
visual information in our brain to understand

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.090
how we are moving with respect to the world.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.080
Finally we looked at how to compute the derivative
of a rotation matrix. It’s the product of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.120
two matrices: it’s a skew-symmetric matrix
multiplied by the original rotation matrix.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.860
The skew-symmetric matrix is computed on the
angular velocity of the body; that’s the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.930
vector L about which the body is instantaneously
rotating multiplied by the rate of rotation

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.629
about that axis.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.120
The skew-symmetric matrix has got a number
of interesting properties. In particular it’s

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.909
singular. That is, its determinate is always
equal to 0, and its transpose is the negative

00:04:54.909 --> 00:05:01.110
value of itself. In the case of three dimensions,
as shown here, we can clearly see a zero diagonal,

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.199
and the fact that the matrix only contains
three unique elements, x, y and z, Each of

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.120
which appear once with a positive sign, and
once with a negative sign.
