00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.420
In this section, we’re going to talk about
measuring the magnetic field. A simple and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.010
familiar type of magnetic field sensor is
the magnetic compass. The compass was discovered

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.740
by the Chinese over 2,000 years ago. It contains
a magnetized needle that aligns with the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
Earth’s magnetic field. The Earth rotates
about an axis that passes through the North

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.070
and South geographic poles. The Earth itself
is a gigantic magnet and the North and South

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.149
poles of the magnet do not correspond to the
North and South geographic poles of the Earth.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.319
We can imagine the magnetic field lines from
this giant internal magnet passing out of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.449
the surface of the planet, arcing through
space, and then diving back in to the ground

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.069
at the North magnetic pole.
The red arrow that I’m holding represents

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.510
approximately one of the Earth’s magnetic
field lines. We can think of these as imaginary

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.049
lines which come out of the Earth, arc through
the sky and land again at the North Pole of

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:07.299
the planet. Now, I have aligned this arrow
by measuring the three components of the Earth’s

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.860
magnetic field using my phone. And, at the
moment, the way I have this arrow and the phone

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.930
oriented, the only component of magnetic field
that’s non zero is in the Y direction, that’s

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.740
the, this direction on my, on my phone.
The magnetic poles of the Earth are constantly

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.880
moving and that’s a bit problematic for
a sensor like a compass which points at the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
magnetic poles. We need to understand something
about where the magnetic poles are with respect

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.340
to the geographic poles and how they are moving.
The needle of a compass points towards the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.979
Magnetic North Pole of the planet. But, true
North or geographic North is in a different

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.729
direction. Here, we have a right-handed coordinate
frame where the axes are pointing to geographic

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.229
North, geographic East and vertically down
toward the center of the planet. Imagine now

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.289
a plane that contains the magnetic field vector
which is denoted by a red arrow and the symbol B.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.180
Angle between this plane and the geographic
North direction is the magnetic declination angle D.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.720
This diagram shows magnetic declination for

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.000
the year 2010 and we can see that it varies
quite significantly across the planet. Magnetic

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.920
North can be up to plus or minus 20 degrees
away from true North. These values become

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.050
quite extreme in the vicinity of the South
Magnetic Pole which we can see very clearly

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.630
here. If you’re sailing a boat and you’re
using a nautical chart, the appropriate magnetic

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.050
declination is typically marked somewhere
on that chart. Magnetic declination varies

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.420
over time and this fascinating video shows the contour lines of magnetic declination

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.280
varying over periods of hundreds of years.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.800
The magnetic field lines are generally not parallel to the surface of the Earth.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.860
In the Southern Hemisphere, the magnetic field lines

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.370
come out of the ground. And, in the Northern
Hemisphere, the magnetic field lines disappear

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.910
into the ground. So, we can introduce another
angle which is referred to as magnetic inclination

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.560
denoted typically by the symbol I and that
represents the angle of the magnetic field

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.090
line with respect to the surface of the Earth.
And, this is a map of magnetic inclination

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.760
over the surface of the planet. The sign convention
used is Northern Hemisphere centric. So, if

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.140
the magnetic field line is descending in to
the ground, the inclination angle is considered

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.730
to be positive. Here is another chart and
this one shows the strength of the magnetic

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.470
field, the magnitude of the magnetic field
vector and this is units of nano teslas. That’s

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.280
10 to the minus 9 Tesla. For comparison, a
modern MRI machine has a magnetic field strength

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.370
of around 4 to 8 Tesla. That’s a hundred
thousand times stronger than the magnetic

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.760
field strength of the Earth.
