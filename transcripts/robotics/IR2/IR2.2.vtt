00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.480
Now that I have my robot and a coordinate
frame, I can measure the position of the robot

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.230
with respect to the coordinate frame. So,
with my tape measure, I can see that the robot

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.960
has got an x coordinate of 18 centimetres
and it has got a y coordinate of 16 centimetres.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.650
So I can describe the position of the robot
in terms of a vector and the elements of the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.039
vector are 18 and 16 in units of centimetres.
Now, I can introduce other objects in the

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.640
environment. A robot can have a little friend.
His little friend can sit over there, and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.570
I can measure the position of the little friend
as well. And, he is sitting at about 38 centimetres

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.010
in the x direction, that’s his x coordinate.
And, the y coordinate, not so easy to measure,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.760
but I could say perhaps it’s 6 centimetres
in the y direction. So, any object within

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.519
this environment I can describe their position
in terms of two coordinates with respect to

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.969
the coordinate frame that I laid down at the
beginning.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.269
Describing the position of the robot is an
important part of the problem, but it’s

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.770
not quite enough. We need to be able to say
something about which way this robot is facing.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
So, if this robot wanted to move towards this
robot, we need to know whether it’s going

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.000
to move forwards, to the left, to the right,
backwards. So, this robot is very different

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.890
to this robot, to this robot, to this robot.
It’s important to be able to describe which

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.610
way it’s facing. And, in order to describe
which way it’s facing, we can use the tools

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.320
that we've already been discussing. And, what
we can do is we can attach another coordinate

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.910
frame to our robot. In this case, I’m going
to use a green coordinate frame and I’m

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.560
going to stick it on to the bottom of the
robot with some, with some blue tack. Now

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.890
with the robots here, we can describe its
orientation - the way it’s facing in the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.350
world - by the orientation of this coordinate
frame with respect to this coordinate frame.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.100
So, we can describe then the position of this
new coordinate frame that we've attached to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.290
the robot in terms of a motion. We do a motion
from the original coordinate frame, our reference

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.729
coordinate frame, sometimes called the world
coordinate frame, that we move the origin

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.290
of this frame to here and then we rotate.
We can do the same thing for the little robot.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.469
We can describe its pose with respect to the
world coordinate frame. To do that, I’m

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.400
going to attach a blue coordinate frame to
this little robot, and, I’m going to orient

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.859
it so that the x-axis is pointing forward.
And this is a pretty common convention for

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:39.039
airplane, ships, cars, robots. We make the
x-axis the direction of normal motion for the machine.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.760
Now, we have a very simple representation

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.420
of the original environment where it’s described
now entirely in terms of a number of coordinate

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.930
frames which represent the pose of the important
entities in that environment with respect

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.349
to the world coordinate frame. Now, just as
we did for the big robot, we can consider

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.569
the pose of the little robot in terms of a
motion. So, imagine that we move the coordinate

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.489
frame from where it lies on top of the reference
coordinate frame. We make a translational

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.099
motion, move it horizontally, we move it vertically,
and then we rotate it and rotate it quite

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.530
a bit until it lies on top of that coordinate
frame. So, that is the pose of the little

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.269
robot with respect to the world coordinate
frame described in terms of a positional component

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.529
and a rotational component.
So, now we have described the pose of the

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:34.700
little robot with respect to the world coordinate
frame. We previously described the pose of

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.120
the big robot with respect to the world coordinate
frame. But, we can also describe the pose

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.689
of the little robot with respect to the big
robot, and we can do that by picking up the

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:50.099
big robot’s coordinate frame and we make
a translation in the world x direction, and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.209
then in the world y direction, and then we
rotate it until the axis line up. And, that

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.439
then is a relative motion or relative pose
from this coordinate frame to this one.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.870
I’m going to use this Greek letter which
is pronounced as ksi to represent pose. In

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.480
a two-dimensional world, pose has got three
parameters: x and y which represent the offset

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.880
from the origin of one coordinate frame to
the origin of the next coordinate frame, and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.000
the angle Theta which represents the rotation
from one coordinate frame to the next. There

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.620
is an important convention when we talk about
the rotation of one coordinate frame with

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.110
respect to another, and that is that angles
increase positively in the anticlockwise direction.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.840
So, if this is my original coordinate frame,
if I rotate that by the angle Theta, it looks

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.530
like this. Importantly, positive rotation
is in the anticlockwise direction.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.000
We can also think about pose as a move, a
motion in the x direction and in the y direction,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.280
and then a rotation or twist by the amount Theta.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.810
So, we can describe that the position of this
new coordinate frame that we have attached

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.380
to the robot in terms of a motion. We do a
motion from the original coordinate frame,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.440
our reference coordinate frame, sometimes
called the world coordinate frame, that we

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.540
move the origin of this frame to here, and
then we rotate.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:28.090
So, let’s summarise what we've covered in
this section. A point can be described by

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.090
a vector with respect to a particular coordinate
frame, and, when we do that, we introduce

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.310
some additional notation. We use the symbol
lower case p to represent a vector. The A

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.520
in front denotes the coordinate frame from
which the vector starts. So, this vector begins

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.660
from the origin of coordinate frame A. The
trailing B is the destination. It’s the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.580
name of the point that the vector points to.
The pose of a coordinate frame can be described

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.610
with respect to another coordinate frame.
I used this fat arrow to represent the pose

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.580
- the motion from coordinate frame A to coordinate
frame B. Now, the motion is more complex than

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.640
just a translation like an ordinary vector.
It includes a translation and a rotation,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.020
so that’s why I used a different kind of
arrow. You know that it’s fatter and it’s

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.920
got a different kind of head.
Symbolically, I describe it like this. I use

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.980
the Greek letter ksi to denote that we’re
talking about a pose. The leading A is the

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.360
frame of reference. That’s where I start
from. The trailing B is where I want to end

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.290
up. This symbol describes a relative motion,
a relative pose from the coordinate frame

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:46.670
A to the coordinate frame B. We can consider
a pose as a motion. We can consider it as

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.560
a translation and a rotation. And, for the
two-dimensional case, the pose is described

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.360
by three numbers: two translational components
and one rotational component.
