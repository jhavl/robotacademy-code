00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.469
When we refer to the sensitivity of people
to different wavelengths of light we use a

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.320
unit called lumens, and lumens are defined.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.250
So at the wavelength 555 nanometers, which
is green, one watt of light creates a sensation

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.449
of 683 lumens.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.130
At a wavelength of 500 nanometers—which
is blue—a one watt light source would only

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.249
get a sensation of 220 lumens.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.100
So it is the same amount of electronic energy,
but if it is concentrated at that wavelength,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.250
it produces a smaller sensation to the human
observer and if we had one watt of electronic

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.690
energy at 800 nanometers it would produce
zero lumens—we can’t see it, it results

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.210
in no sensation at all.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.339
So we can look at the human luminosity response
and there are two of these: there is our night

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.150
time response which is called the scotopic
response and a day time response, the photopic

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.150
response.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.610
This is our overall sensation to light at
a particular wavelength, and it is clear that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.460
at night we are much more sensitive to shorter
wavelengths, the bluer colours, than we are

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.200
during the day time.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.530
We talked before that humans have got three
types of cone cells in the backs of our eyes,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.780
the short medium and long wavelength cones.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.070
Because we have three of them we are referred
to as being trichromats, tri meaning we have

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.450
three color sensors in our eyes.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.579
Humans are somewhat unusual amongst mammals
in having three color receptors; most mammals

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.149
only have two.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.340
And this graph shows the response of the short
and long wavelength cones for a typical mammal.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.189
Many birds are tetrachromats; that means that
they have four different types of cones cells

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.590
and the response of the bird’s cone cells
are shown here.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.659
Now clearly there must be some evolutionary
advantage for birds to have four cone cells.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.170
It gives them a better ability to discriminate
colors.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.790
We can argue that perhaps for the other mammals
there is no need to have three cone cells,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.860
two is enough.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.120
Not all humans have perfect trichromatic vision.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620
Many humans suffer from color blindness and
I am one of those people.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.340
I suffer from a red, green color deficiency
and what that means for me is that the sensitivity

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.400
of my medium wavelength cone is shifted a
bit to the right, so my medium wavelength

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.970
cone response overlaps my long wavelength
cone response.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.290
So the two cone responses are almost equal
and that makes it very hard for me to distinguish

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.360
reds from greens.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.680
Now this is a hereditary defect, this particular
gene is on the tip of the X chromosome and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.720
is passed from males to males via females.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.580
Color blindness is reasonably prevalent in
the community, particularly amongst males,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.150
and the particular defect that I have is shared
by six per cent of men in the population.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.080
It is quite difficult to try and explain to
people what it is like to be color blind.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.260
This slide is trying to illustrate to somebody
with normal color vision how the world looks

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.822
with these different types of color defects,
whether someone is missing their L cone, their

00:03:21.822 --> 00:03:24.980
M cone or their S cone.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.430
So here we have the spectrum of the illuminant
and in this case this is the spectrum of the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.170
noon day sun as measured on the surface of
the earth, so it is not the smooth black body

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.400
curve that we looked at earlier, it has got
lumps and bumps in it due to absorption of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.720
parts of the spectrum by molecules in the
atmosphere and here is the luminance of the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.379
light that is being reflected from the brick.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.280
And that is obtained from the reflectance
function for the red brick multiplied by the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.000
illuminance spectrum.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.769
So the light from the sun reflected from the
brick has got this particular luminance spectrum.

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.620
The final step is to apply a number of filters
or response functions to the incoming luminance

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.239
and in our eye we apply three different response
functions.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.610
So there are three different versions of M;
the response function.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.360
So let’s consider firstly the blue response
function; so we take the incoming luminance

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.160
and we filter it with the response of the
blue cone and we can see that here.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.130
Now the total response of the cone is the
integral of the luminance multiplied by the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.700
response function, and that is the area underneath
the curve, that is what is shown here as the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.410
solid mass of blue.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.610
So the area underneath this curve is the total
amount of energy, it is the total response

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.440
of the blue cone in the retina for this particular
incoming luminance.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.950
Similarly for the green cone, we apply the
green cones response function, its own version

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.791
of M of lambda and then we integrate the area
underneath the curve, and that is what is

00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:05.880
shown here as a solid mass of green and we
do exactly the same thing for the red cone.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.630
We have taken an incoming luminance spectrum,
applied three filters to it, integrated the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.950
response of those filters and the results
are three numbers an amount of red, green

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.660
and blue.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.000
This process sounds complicated, but it has
done a very clever thing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.110
If we consider that the spectrum of illuminance,
that is, the spectrum of the light that is

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.750
entering out eyes from a particular object,
it says something about the material properties

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.690
of that object; an apple, for instance, is
red; a leaf of a plant is green.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.300
All of these different objects in the world
have got a different spectrum.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.310
But to describe a spectrum we need an infinite
number of numbers.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.930
It is a continuous functional wavelength.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.820
It is an infinite dimensional signal.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.630
But by applying three spectral filters to
this incoming light and integrating the output

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.070
of the signal after it has passed to each
of these filters, we are left simply with

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.290
three numbers.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.300
So we have reduced an infinite dimensional
signal simply to three numbers or to three

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.460
dimensions … performed a massive dimensionality
reduction.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.020
A consequence of this dimensionality reduction
is the possibility of ambiguity; that is,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.290
that there are an infinite number of different
luminance spectrum that will give exactly

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.610
the same values of R, G and B.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.450
We refer to such spectra as metamers; that
is, different spectra that give you exactly

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.960
the same R, G and B value.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.360
But clearly this is not a significant problem
in everyday life; it is not something that

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.950
we worry or stress about, so we have evolved
a good enough solution to the problem.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.220
We can recognise objects by reducing the dimensionality
of the signals which indicate what they are

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.630
made of into just three quantities, three
numbers.
