00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.920
Next, we are going to look at the inertia
term. That's the torque required to accelerate

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.650
the joints of the arm. That's this term here.
So, we'll cross the other two out.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.730
Now, I'm going to compute the inertia matrix
of our robot, and that's yet another method

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.269
on the two-link robot object, and the method
is called "inertia" and the arguments to that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.290
are the joint angles of the robot Q1 and Q2.
And, here we have the 2x2 inertia matrix of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.650
our robot. Once again, we can see that it
is a function of kinematic and dynamic parameters

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.380
of a robot, and it's also a function of the
configuration of the robot, and we can see

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.140
sine and cosine of Q2 appearing in this expression.
Here is the inertia matrix for our two link

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.490
robot manipulator. It's a 2x2 matrix and it's
a symmetric matrix; and that means that this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.340
term here is equal to this term here. And,
we can see that the inertia matrix is quite

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.189
complex and it is not constant.
We can see that the elements in this matrix

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.260
are functions of the joint angles Q2, as well
as the masses of the robot link, the kinematic

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
parameters A1 and A2, and the position of
the centre of mass, C2. We can write it in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.130
simplified form where we have just three unique
elements, I11, I22 on the principal diagonal,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.260
and I12 and I21 on the opposite diagonal.
And, as I just mentioned, the matrix is symmetric

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.280
so I12 equals I21.
The vector of torques acting on the robot's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.170
joints are given by the inertia matrix multiplied
by the vector of joint accelerations. Now,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.140
we can expand that out, and we can highlight
now the two terms on the diagonal.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.620
In the previous lecture when we considered
robot joint control, life was simple. We had

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.409
a relationship between the torque that the
motor applies to a joint, the acceleration

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.320
of a joint and the inertia of that joint.
Now, we can see that things are not quite

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.630
so straightforward. We can see that there
is a relationship between torque 1 and the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.099
acceleration of joint 1 just like we had in
the simpler case. But we now also have these

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.870
disturbance torques. That means that the torque
acting on joint 1 is due not just to the acceleration

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.730
of joint 1, but also to the acceleration of
joint 2.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.490
Imagine for a moment that joint 1 is stationary.
It's non-accelerating. The joint control is

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.170
trying to keep it stationary. If joint number
2 starts to accelerate, it's going to exert

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.220
a torque on joint number 1, which the joint
1 motor controller is going to have to deal

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.670
with. It's going to have to come up with some
extra torque, apply it to the motor to stop

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.720
joint 1 moving, due to the influence of joint
2. We're going to compute the inertia of this

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.940
robot numerically. We're going to use the
inertia method and going to compute it for

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.300
joint angle zero, zero, and this is the inertia
matrix and we can see that it is symmetric.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.290
This element here equals this element here.
And, just to remind ourselves of the configuration

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.840
of this robot, we are going to plot it. There
it is. So, this is the robot with its arm

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.920
fully outstretched. Now, what we can do is
to change the configuration. So, I'm going

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.520
to put the robot in to a configuration where
the second joint angle is 90 degrees. So,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.730
now the robot looks like this. And, I can
compute the inertia for this new configuration,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.650
0 pi/2. And, we can see that some elements
of the inertia matrix have changed.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.800
In fact, they have been reduced. And, this
element here, which is the inertia seen by

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.410
joint 1 is reduced. And that is because the
centre of mass of joint 2 is now closer to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.010
the rotational axis of joint 1. Now, I can
bring that in even further. Let's see what

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.450
it looks like if I put the robot in to a configuration
where the first angle is 0, and the second

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.769
joint angle is equal to pi or 180 degrees
and the arm is folded back on itself, which

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.180
may not actually be physically possible, but
let's work with that.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.061
Now, I can look at the inertia in this configuration
and see that it is even further reduced. That's

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:17.250
because all the mass of the robot is as close
as it possibly can get to the rotational axis

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.989
of joint 1. So, if I collapse that figure,
then what we can see is progressively the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.040
magnitude of the elements in the inertia matrix
become less and less as we increase joint

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.350
angle 2.
And, this is a topic that we will revisit

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.380
shortly. The problem for a joint control system,
when the inertia that it has to deal with

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.879
varies with the configuration of the robot.
