00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.660
In this section, I'd like to talk about why
robots are useful. Why do we need robots?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
The first example I am going to give is what's
called robotic surgery but that is a bit of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.640
a misnomer. It's actually robot-enabled surgery.
And highly trained human surgeons are the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.669
key part of the system. The robot part of
the system is shown over here and there are a

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.730
number of tools which are inside the body
of the patient. There are tools which carry

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.420
very small cameras and the information from
those cameras is presented to the surgeon

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.579
in a stereoscopic or 3D display. The surgeon
looks at this 3D imagery and adjusts what

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.839
we could consider as some small joysticks.
Those small joysticks control the motion of

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.249
tools which are also inside the patient's
body.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:55.649
So the surgeon is doing all the skilled work.
He's using his eyes to interpret the 3D imagery.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.309
He's using everything he knows about medicine
in order to control the tools inside the human

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.480
body to do the job that needs to be done.
The key innovation here is the surgeon is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.790
virtually inside the human body. In the old
days, we needed to make very large openings

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.220
in the human body so that the surgeon could
get his very large hands in there to do the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.659
work that needed to be done.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.200
With this robot surgery technology, we are
able to make a number of very very small incisions

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.030
in the body of the patient into which we insert
these very small tools and cameras so the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.399
outcomes for the patient are a whole lot better.
So robotic surgery is really a misnomer. It's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.649
like the teleoperation system that we looked
at earlier on which was used to perform manipulation

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.960
of radioactive material. It's a very similar
technology being used here to virtually place

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.469
a surgeon inside the body of a patient.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.270
We can also use robot technology to make us
stronger. This is a technology called an exoskeleton.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.079
It's a wearable robot. We strap ourselves
into it. It straps onto our ankles, onto our

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.429
knees, onto our thighs and onto our trunk.
It monitors how we move. And it's made of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.750
very strong materials and it's got very strong
motors. So as we move, it moves with us and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.160
its strength augments our own strength.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.610
Here is a video of an exoskeleton system at
work. This is some video that I took at a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.010
robot exhibition recently. We can see the
gentleman wearing the exoskeleton is able

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.350
to handle this large weight quite effortlessly.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.320
There we go. So this is a way that limitations

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.110
of human strength can be augmented by robot
technology. The intelligence in performing

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.310
the motion or performing the action comes
from the human being but the raw strength,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.890
the brute strength comes from the robot that
he is wearing.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.770
Another really important role for robots today
is managing assets, as a society we have a massive

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.630
investment in assets in terms of power lines,
water pipe lines, gas pipe lines and sewer

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.080
systems. And in order to maintain the health
of those assets, they need to be periodically

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.100
inspected and that's very labor-intensive. And some of these inspection jobs are fairly unpleasant.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.380
Imagine if it was your job to inspect sewer
systems. It's dark, it's unpleasant, and actually

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.970
a little dangerous. So people have been building
robots that can be placed in the pipe lines

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.970
to perform the inspection without sending
human beings down there. So robotic researchers

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.070
have been developing robot systems for performing
this kind of inspection work. And here we

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.440
see an example of a pipe inspection robot.
It's got wheels to propel it through the pipe,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.000
it's got lights and cameras.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.580
A massive amount of money is spent each year
on inspecting power lines and there's a couple

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.870
of approaches to doing this. One is to fly
a robot along the power line or else to build

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.720
a robot that can crawl along the power lines.
Flying helicopters near power lines is a dangerous

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.880
business. And each year, a number of helicopter
crashes are caused by the helicopter coming

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.140
into too close proximity with the wires that
it is inspecting. So this is exactly the sort

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.930
of job, a dangerous job that a robot should
do.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.160
Perhaps our most important asset is the planet
on which we live and researchers are developing

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.930
all manner of robots to inspect and monitor
the health of our planet. A few of them are

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.090
seen here. They are flying robots that could
be flown into dangerous weather systems such

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.250
as hurricanes or cyclones, robots that can
explore the inside of volcanic craters, blimp-based

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.840
robots for monitoring the health of the Amazon
rain forest, underwater exploration robots

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.620
and Antarctic exploration robots, and even robotic
boats for monitoring the quality of water

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.280
in the storages that provide drinking water
for cities.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.729
It's a dangerous business sending humans beneath
the surface of our oceans. Human divers are

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.360
limited in the depths that they can dive to.
They also require a support vessel on the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.240
surface from which they dive and for which
they return. Because of this limitation on

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.069
humans under the water, there's been an enormous
amount of research over recent decades in

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.909
building underwater robot systems. These are
completely autonomous. They've got a number

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.659
of sensors on board and we can send them off
to do missions like photographic survey of

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:27.689
wrecks, exploring for minerals and examining
the health of assets such as coral reefs.

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.479
Another place that humans cannot go is to
other planets. And here is a collection of

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.659
robots that have been sent to Mars. Here in
the front we have the small robots. Sojourner,

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.620
which was sent in 1997. Behind that is a robot
which is a copy of Spirit and Opportunity

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.389
which were sent to Mars in 2003. And over
here, we have this giant robot, Curiosity,

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.879
which was sent to Mars in 2012. Here is an
example of some pictures of Mars taken from

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.740
the Curiosity rover. And again, here we can
see the size of the Curiosity rover with respect

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.300
to a human engineer.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.460
The important message here is that there are
environments that we want to go to learn information

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.999
about the health or the state of the environment.
The deep oceans, rain forest, volcanoes or

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:20.340
other planets. But it's currently either too
expensive or it's too dangerous to send human

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.330
beings to those places. So we send robots
there instead and they serve as our proxies

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.449
or our agents and we use sensory information
from those robots to learn about that environment

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.349
rather than having to send human beings carrying
instruments to those places.
