00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.540
In the last lecture we learned how to import
a digital image into a computer and we learned

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.769
that an image inside a computer is just a
big bunch of numbers. More precisely it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.650
a rectangular array of numbers which we can
consider to be a matrix. Now getting the image

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.070
into the computer is just the first step.
We need to manipulate this image in various

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.550
ways so that we can extract the information
from that image which is sufficient to hand

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.870
across to a robot to allow it to do its job.
So in this lecture and the next one, we're

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.969
going to learn about some fundamental ways
to transform images so as to help us in the

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.670
process of extracting meaning.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.480
These techniques fall into a category which
is called image processing, which is how we

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.310
take one image and transform it into a different
image which helps us in our task of extracting

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.850
that meaning. So the sorts of transformations
that we would be interested in considering

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.500
are; how do we enhance the contrast of an
image? How do we reduce the resolution of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.979
an image? How do we highlight horizontal lines
in an image or how do we highlight vertical

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.770
lines in an image? Or how do we highlight
things that are red or that are green or that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.380
are blue. So these are some fundamental techniques
that will help us in our journey of equipping

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.790
robots with vision.
