00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.569
I've used the term kinematics a number of
times in this lecture and I haven't really

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.950
been very clear about what it means. Kinematics
is a branch of mathematics that studies the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.500
motion of a body or a system of bodies. Kinematics
is concerned with the positions of things

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.789
or the angles between things and is concerned
with velocities. These can be translational

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.890
velocities or they could be angular velocities.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.219
Kinematics is not concerned with forces and
moments. That's the business of dynamics.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.550
So in kinematics people study mechanisms such
as the ones shown here and try to understand

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.280
how the motion of one body is related to the
motion of another body.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.219
I have shown here examples of a number of
quite complex mechanisms. In kinematics, is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.499
the study of the motion of the various components
of these mechanisms. In robotics, we consider

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.429
two kinematic problems.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.190
First one, in what we discuss in this particular
lecture is what's called the forward kinematic

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.690
problem. And that is given the robot joint
angles, what's the pose of the robot's tool tip?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.079
The second problem is called the inverse kinematics.
And we're going to discuss that in the next

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.640
lecture. Given that I know the pose that I
want the robot in-defector to have, the problem

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.240
is to determine what are the joint angles
required in order to achieve that. Let me

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.210
leave you with this quote I really like. It's
about kinematics.
