00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.320
Instead of just displaying values of individual
pixels I can display the values of the pixels

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.130
along a line in the scene. Let’s have a
look at this.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.041
To do that I use the line button here and
I click the first point here and I am going

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:22.520
to click a second point over here. Draws a
line on the original image and in the other

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.030
window we see what we call an intensity profile.
So we can see that the intensity is initially

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.230
quite bright—we’re on the wall—then
as we move further towards the right along

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.640
that line the intensity drops, gets quite
dark in the doorway. If you come out of the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.030
doorway and cross a section of wall again
the pixel values have got a large value, it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.090
is a bright wall, and then they fall down
to a lower value as we go through the next

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.090
window.
So, this is the pattern of pixel values as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.480
we move along a line within the original scene.
Another thing we can do is to create what

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.040
is called a region of interest, effectively
to zoom in onto a rectangular region within

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.300
the image. So let’s have a look at that.
What I will do is I will remove this profile

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.799
image and I will click the zoom button, and
I will lasso an area of the image interactively

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.290
and the result is a smaller image which contains
a sub region of the original image.
