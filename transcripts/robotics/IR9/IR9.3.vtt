00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.870
Let’s do a quick introduction to skew symmetric
matrices. These matrices are sometimes called

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.160
anti-symmetric matrices and they have this
interesting property that the transpose is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.410
equal to the negative of the original matrix.
These matrices are always singular. Their

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.650
determinant is always equal to zero.
Any matrix is the sum of a symmetric matrix

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.099
and a skew symmetric matrix. In three dimensions,
we can write the skew symmetric matrix which

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.300
is a function of a three element vector in
this fashion. So, we have a vector whose elements

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.460
are X, Y, and Z. The skew symmetric matrix
looks like this. The obvious features are

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.320
a diagonal of zeros. There are two X's in
there. Two Y's and two Z's. One of them has

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.170
a positive sign and one of them has a negative
sign.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.510
We can also write a vector cross product as
a matrix vector product. One of the matrices

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
is a skew symmetric matrix computed from the
first vector.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.710
Here’s a skew symmetric matrix and I am
going share with you some rules of thumb for

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.390
how you work out which elements are where
when you write this matrix down. To start

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.970
with, there is a zero diagonal. So, that’s
pretty easy. You write three zeros down the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.000
diagonal.
There is also what I think of as an exclusion

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.920
rule. So, in row X and in column Y, that element
will not be an extra Y. It will be the other

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.740
thing. And in this case, it will be a Z.
If we consider a cyclic rotation sequence.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.020
So, we have an endless sequence - X, Y, Z,
X, Y, Z and so on. If I consider the element

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.020
in column Y and in row X, moving from Y to
X, it is going backwards in that cyclic rotation

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.010
sequence. Because we are going backwards in
the sequence, I am going to put a minus sign

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.090
on that particular element.
If we look at this one over here, we are going

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.909
from Z to X. And, that’s a forward in the
cyclic rotation sequence. So, we give this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.140
element a positive sign.
