00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.940
We've talked in earlier lectures about perspective
projection. This is the transformation of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.150
points in a three-dimensional world into a
two-dimensional image. And involves the loss

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.980
of a dimension it leads to artefacts such
as lines which are parallel in the three-dimensional

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.019
world appearing to converge in the two-dimensional
image or projection of that three-dimensional

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.820
world.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.390
Another example here a bunch of parallel lines,
parallel three trunks which appear to converge

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.719
at a point. We talked early on about the pinhole
imaging model. We have a three-dimensional

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.980
scene and it projects into a two-dimensional
image. There is no unique inverse of the perspective

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.050
projection. Any number of different three-dimensional
models will lead to exactly the same two-dimensional

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.910
projection. The lack of a unique inverse is really important consequence of the perspective projection.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.119
For robotics, knowledge of the three-dimensional
world is really important. A robot needs to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.189
know how far away is the object did it wants
to grasp. A mobile robot needs to know whether

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.710
the space in front of it is free to be driven
in or whether there is an obstacle there.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.110
So the important topic that we can uncover
in this lecture is how do we recover the third

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.610
dimension. Thatâ€™s been lost in the perspective
projection process when we capture an image.
