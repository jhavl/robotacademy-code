00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.000
Photographers frequently refer to something
called color temperature; color temperature

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.339
is saying something about the spectrum of
the light that they are looking at in terms

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.840
to the equivalent black body radiator. So
the spectrum associated with this red sunset

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.609
is equivalent to a black body radiator of
about 2000 to 3000 degrees kelvin. It is a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.720
very reddish light. A tungsten light is equivalent
to a color temperature of around about 3000

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.870
kelvin. The spectrum of the sun at midday
is equivalent to a black body radiator of

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.480
around 5000 to 5400 kelvin. A photographer
would say that the sunlight is bluer then

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.380
the tungsten light, or we can say tungsten
light is more red then the midday sun.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.940
In the case of an overcast day, the color
temperature is, in fact, even higher, the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.850
point in the world is no longer illuminated
by the white light from the sun, it is illuminated

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.049
by the blue light from the sky and this excess
amount of blue in the light is equivalent

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.320
to a much, much hotter black body radiator.
So a photographer would refer to this as a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.810
color temperature in the range 8000 to 10 000
kelvin.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.060
Our sun is a very hot object in space and
functions as a black body radiator, but by

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.940
the time the light from the sun finds its
way down to ground level the spectrum has

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.550
been dramatically altered and that is because
of a number of chemicals in the atmosphere—we

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.170
have ozone, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide
and so on—and each of them remove parts

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.770
of the radiation that comes from the sun.
So by the time the light gets to the ground

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.420
the spectrum is a little bit different from
an ideal black body radiator. The peak of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.299
the spectrum of a light by the time it reaches
the ground is around about

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.080
550 nanometers … it is a little green color
and, not surprisingly, that is the color that

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.560
our eyes are most sensitive to.
A lot of the energy that comes from a black

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.760
body radiator is emitted in parts of the spectrum
that we cannot see in these longer wavelengths,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.769
and this is one of the reasons that these
tungsten light bulbs are being phased out.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.540
They convert some of the electrical energy
into light that we can see, but they convert

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.719
an awful lot of it into heat which does not
help us to see. They are not particularly

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.379
efficient.
So there is a lot of energy being omitted

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.540
at these longer wavelengths, so if we look
at this spectrum here, we can see that the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.370
visible part of the spectrum, that region
between 400 and 700 nanometers, is actually

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.079
a very small part of the overall electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.019
With our eyes we are able to sense electromagnetic
radiation in this very narrow part of the

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.329
overall spectrum.
Although we cannot see infra-red radiation,

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.719
we can still sense it and we can feel it as
heat, as warmth on our skin. Infra-red radiation

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.719
was discovered by William Herschel, a German-born
English astronomer back in the 1700s. He built

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.819
an enormous telescope and discovered many
stars and planets.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.260
And one day he took the light from his telescope
passed it through a prism onto a table and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.809
he put a thermometer into different parts
of the spectrum on the table. He was trying

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.019
to measure the temperature of blue and yellow
and violet and red.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.629
And what surprised him was that when he put
the thermometer into an area of the table

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.870
where he couldn’t see any light, the thermometer
still recorded a high temperature, so there

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.849
was radiation that was heating the thermometer
but he was unable to see it, so he discovered

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.829
infra-red radiation. He referred to them as
calorific rays.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.689
I mentioned before that we can sense infra-red
radiation as heat. There are devices called

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.529
thermal cameras and they are very sensitive
to this infra-red radiation in what is called

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:58.349
the thermal or long
infra-red band between 9 and 14 micrometres.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.040
That is 9000 to 14 000 nanometers, the units
that we were using previously.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.120
And in that part of the spectrum human beings
omit energy, and so you can see that people

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.690
here are warm against a colder background.
This is our natural body temperature, 37 degrees

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.120
Celsius, it means that we ourselves are black
body radiators and we are omitting not much

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.419
but a small amount of
infra-red energy and a thermal camera can

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.509
pick this up. Thermal cameras are often used
to diagnose heat loss from buildings; the

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.360
outside of a building should be cool, but
if there are hot spots it generally tends

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.849
to indicate the heat is leaking from inside
the building to the outside world.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.889
The fire beetle is exquisitely sensitive to
infra-red radiation. It likes to lay its eggs

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.479
into burnt trees, so it goes hunting for forest
fires and to do that it uses special infra-red

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.300
sensing organs built into its thorax.
There are also a large number of non-black

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.750
body illuminance: light omitting diodes, for
instance, have got a spectral characteristic

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.659
like this quite differently shaped to the
black body omission spectrum, so here we can

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:15.009
see the omission of a blue LED, a green LED
and a red LED.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:21.379
We see that the energy concentrated into a
fairly narrow spectral band. There is no wasting

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.400
of omission in the infra-red part of the spectrum,
for instance.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.419
A compact fluorescent tube has got a very
complex spectrum: the light is a mixture of

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.340
the light omitted by a large number of different
phosphors, the white layer inside the helical

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.840
tube which is excited by the gas discharge.
So each phosphor emits light at a different

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.009
wavelength. The overall combination of these
different wavelengths appears to our eye to

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.030
be white. Another non-black body illuminate
is the laser; the laser is perhaps somewhat

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.830
similar to the light omitting diode that we
looked at a moment ago, except that the spectrum

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.659
is extremely narrow. Finally, these are the
specular emissions associated with the red,

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:11.550
green and blue phosphors in an old fashion
cathode ray tube and this shows the emission

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.900
spectrum of the blue phosphor, this curve
here; the green phosphor, this curve here;

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.120
and the red phosphor which contains a large
number of quite narrow band emissions, but

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.120
together collectively they appear to the human
eye as red.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.270
As I mentioned a moment ago, the light that
reaches the surface of the planet is partly

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.349
absorbed by various molecules in the atmosphere
of the planet. Water, in particular, is a

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:47.000
very strong absorber of light. This graph
shows the amount of absorption of light as

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.550
a function of wavelength and we can see that
there is a region of the spectrum where there

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.650
is minimal light absorption. If we look just
at the visible band and then mark blue and

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.319
red we can see that red light is absorbed
more than blue light and this explains why,

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.030
when you are under water and the further you
go under water, the light has got much more

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.669
of a blue tint to it—you tend to lose colors
like red and green, they tend to disappear

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:20.099
and everything starts to look blue because
only the blue light is able to penetrate through

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:25.419
a big column of water. So let’s summarise:
we have light that comes from an illuminate

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:31.749
and it produces illuminance of the scene and
we can describe that light in terms of its

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:37.409
spectrum, so we use the symbol E to represent
the luminance and it is a function of the

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:41.689
wavelength, and we have looked at various
sorts of illuminance, we looked at black body

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:46.349
radiators, light emitting diodes, compact
fluorescent tubes and lasers, each of these

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.989
have got a different spectral characteristic.
