00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.269
Welcome to week seven in the robotic vision
project. This is the optional week where you

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.480
can take your complete vision system and the
outputs from this can form the inputs to a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.410
robotic arm that you've built.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.439
For this demonstration my robotic arm will
be moving from the coordinate axis here to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.199
the large green triangle followed by the large
green square and will finish on the smaller

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.689
triangle over here.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.489
Let's take a look now at this robot in action.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.180
So as you can see it performed the desired
trajectory. Hopefully yours look something similar.
