00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.870
The way we see the world is actually quite
complex. Our eyes are not like a camera that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.289
takes an image that we then go and process.
As we look at a scene our eye moves continuously

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.011
to different points in the scene in order
to improve its understanding of what is in

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:26.130
front of it. So seeing is actually a very
active process.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
So researchers have developed technology that
allows us to study where a human being is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.320
looking; involves a camera which looks at
the subject’s eyes, and perhaps an illumination

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.790
system. So with this we can work out continuously
and in real time where a human being is looking.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.899
Now this painting was used in a very famous
study that was conducted back in 1967 into

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.640
how a human subject’s gaze depends on the
particular question that they were asked.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.550
So what they could do is take a subject, ask
them a question and then track where their

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.890
eye looked within the painting. So here is
an example: here is one trace, one subject

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.859
trace. You can see that their gaze is moving
all around the room. So of these three questions,

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.310
which question do you think was asked that
led to this particular gaze pattern by that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.759
human subject. I will let you think about
that for a moment.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.020
And here is the answer. The question that
was asked is: ‘What are the material circumstances

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.539
of the family?’.
So in order to answer this question, the human

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.649
subject has directed their gaze towards the
possessions of the particular family. So they’re

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.020
checking out the furniture, they are checking
out the paintings on the wall and so on. So

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.569
given a specific question to a subject, our
eye moves over the scene in a particular way

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.889
so as to best answer the question. It’s
not just a matter of taking a picture and

00:01:53.889 --> 00:02:00.209
processing it: our eye actively moves around
the scene in order to best answer the question.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:09.330
Here is another experiment. See if you can
work out which question has been asked.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.220
We can see that the gaze is checking out particularly
the facial regions of the particular people

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.130
here. So the question that was asked is: ‘What
are the ages of the figures in the painting?’.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
So clearly it is useful to look at the faces
of the people in order to work out what their

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.310
age is.
Third one, in this particular case this is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.430
what the subject’s gaze did. We can see
him checking out the faces, and it is also

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.100
checking out the whole body of each of the
human subjects in this painting. And the question

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.100
that was asked is: ‘What type of clothes
are the family wearing?’.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.810
So given the subject was answering that particular
question, then their gaze is focused just

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.830
on the faces and the clothes of each of the
people. It is not looking at the furniture;

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.790
it is not looking at the paintings; it’s
not looking out the window.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.380
It is important to understand that seeing
is a very active process. Now it is driven

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.180
by perhaps some of the fastest moving muscles
in the human body. So the human eye is able

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.710
to rotate at up to six hundred degrees per
second, and has a phenomenal acceleration,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.630
something like 35000º per second squared,
so amazing muscles are able to point the eye

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.500
very quickly anywhere within the field of
view of the eyes.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.340
So this lovely quote that I like very much
by a very famous early vision researcher David

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.790
Marr. And he says vision is ‘the process
of discovering from images what is present

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.660
in the world and where it is’. So vision
is a process. I think that is a very important

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.819
message to take away when we start to think
about how robots might see.
