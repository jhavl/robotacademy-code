00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Using homographies in MATLAB

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.149
Let's use the previous MATLAB example to illustrate
some principles around homographies. First

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.870
thing I'm going to do is to close these 2
windows and create a new variable called Little

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.500
P, which contains the projection of those
world points. Here we go.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.019
So, this is the image plane coordinates of
the points as viewed by that camera up in

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:30.330
the air. The world points P are a set of 3
dimensional coordinates. Note that the Z coordinate

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.910
of all of these points is equal to 0. So,
I'm going to create a new vector, just P and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.940
it's just the first 2 rows and it contains
all of the columns. So, this is Q. So, Q are

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.879
a set of coordinates of points on the ground
plane that the camera is looking at and P

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.120
is a set of pixel coordinates in the view
from that camera up in the air and now that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.000
I have these 2 sets of corresponding 2-D points,
I can compute an homography. I'll just use

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.030
the homography function and I parse in the
first set of points, little P and the second

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
set of points, Q and here is the homography
matrix that's been computed.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.450
Now that I have the homography H, I can apply
it to a single point or 2 multiple points.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.189
To help me with that, there is a toolbox helper
function called 'homtrans' which applies the

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.340
homography-H to the set of pixels P. This
is our image plane coordinates and the result

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.590
is the set of coordinates of points on the
ground.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.030
We have mapped a set of points in the image
whose coordinates are measured in units of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.670
pixels into a set of points on the ground
plane and there coordinates are described

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.399
in units of metres. Similarly, I can use the
inverse of the homography matrix to go the other way.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.070
So now, I pass in the coordinates of the points on the ground and the result is the set of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.469
image plane coordinates. So, the homography is a really useful tool if I want to map the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.020
coordinates of points between one plane and
another.
