00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.210
In the previous lecture, we looked at transforming
spatial velocity from one coordinate frame

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.760
to another. We did this for the two-dimensional
case and we learned that the relationship

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.240
between velocities is given by a Jacobian
matrix which is actually a function of the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.500
relative orientation between the two coordinate
frames.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.519
For three dimensions, things are actually
quite similar. So, here is a three-dimensional

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.300
reference coordinate frame, a point which
has a spatial velocity with respect to Frame

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.480
A. And, here is Frame B and we can describe
the relative pose between Frame A and Frame

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.329
B. We can show in red the spatial velocity
with respect to Frame B and the relationship

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.350
between the two is given by a Jacobian matrix.
For the three-dimensional case, the Jacobian

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.789
matrix is 6 x 6. And, once again, it is a
function only of the relative orientation

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.750
between the two coordinate frames. It’s
a function of rotation matrix from Frame B

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.560
to Frame A.
Here is an example of an industrial robot.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.360
And, if I apply a particular set of robot
joint angle velocities, I obtain a particular

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.770
spatial velocity for the robot end effector
and those two quantities are related by the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.770
manipulator, Jacobian.
Now, this assumes that the robot end effector

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.280
velocity is defined with respect to the world
coordinate frame, denoted zero here. It’s

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.990
often very useful to describe the velocity
of the end effector with respect to the end

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.060
effector’s coordinate frame. I have denoted
here as Frame 6.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.189
Now, we can write this in terms of a different
Jacobian matrix. This Jacobian matrix relates

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.579
the robot joint angle velocity to the robot
end effector velocity expressed in terms of

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.250
Frame 6.
We can write an expression for the end effector’s

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.320
spatial velocity with respect to Frame 6 in
terms of two Jacobian matrices. This Jacobian

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.479
is the standard robot manipulator Jacobian
matrix that we have talked about previously.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.330
And, this Jacobian matrix is responsible for
transforming velocity from Frame 0 to Frame

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.170
6 and it is a function of the relative pose
from Frame 6 to Frame 0. And, that Jacobian

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.040
matrix, as we introduced in the previous slide,
is a function simply of the rotational part

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.790
of the relative pose.
