00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.600
Welcome to the very last lecture in our online
course, Introduction to Robotics. Congratulations

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.219
to those of you who have made it this far.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.689
I want to do something a bit different in
this particular lecture and talk perhaps less

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.090
about technology and algorithms, and software
and so on, and get into some perhaps bigger

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.360
picture ideas about robots and where they
fit into society. Why robots are important.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.039
Now, It's been, as I say, quite a journey.
We've talked about the history of robots,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:43.850
mankind's fascination with building things
in the image of living organisms, in this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.420
case, the famous digesting duck from many
hundreds of years ago. We've talked about

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.700
fascination with automata. These lifelike
machines which were able to do reasonably

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.450
complex tasks by the standards of the day.
For instance, a figurine of a person with

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.540
mechanical innards that was able to do quite
complex drawings. For instance, the drawing

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.719
here of a ship. And this is from the 1800's.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.420
And then, around the Second World War technology
started to evolve at a very rapid rate, and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.270
this sort of technology - really the precursor
of robots. Manipulation system allowed scientists

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.740
and engineers to manipulate radioactive material
at the distance. And this is really, in my

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.299
belief, the sort of precursor technology to
modern industrial robots.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.320
And the first industrial robots were developed
by this company Unimation Inc. which was founded

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.280
in 1956, first products went into service
in the very early 1960's. So, this sort of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.439
manufacturing robot, the arm robot, builds
stuff, very, very important to our society.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.470
It's a very old technology now. It's getting
on towards 60 years.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.259
So, we've talked about this evolution of robotic
technology, and we've also talked about what

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.820
makes this technology tick. We've talked about
how to build robots. We've talked about how

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.299
we represent the pose of objects in the work
space. We've talked about forward kinematics,

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.510
inverse kinematics, and Jacobians and joint
control and rigid body dynamics. These are

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.430
all the fundamental principles that are really
important if you are building an arm type

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.189
robot. These are the things that we've learnt
in this 60 years since this technology was

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.650
first conceived. The technology came first
and the theory, the mathematics that we've

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.540
learned about, came later.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.489
These robots are really important to modern
industry. Here’s a picture of this kind

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.040
of robot, building motor cars and they also
build computers and move packages around in

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.540
factories and so on. There's more than a million of these arm type robot and work on planet Earth today.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.819
More recently there is this new class of robots.
We call them service robots or field robots.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.409
And, this is an example of a service robot.
It's a robot that performs a service to a

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.439
human being. And this service in this particular
case is cleaning my floor. And these robots

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.299
have become phenomenally popular, more than
10 million of these robots sold. These only

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.489
have been around for only about a decade.
Manufacturing robot had been around for nearly

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.489
60 years. There's only a million of them.
In just 10 over years, we have 10 millions

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.109
of these. And the reasons are that these robots
are much cheaper than the manufacturing robots.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.769
The sort of thing that a person can afford,
a person would like to have, because it provides

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.169
real value. It performs a greatly useful task
around the house.

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.389
So, this is very much the future of robots.
There's going to be robots that work with

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.659
us that are low cost and useful. Of course
in the future, there's going to be many other

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.219
sorts of robot. Perhaps the next sort of robot
that we are going to encounter en masse, I

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.889
think it's going to be the self driving car.
The Google self driving car project has got

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.839
a lot of press, and all of the major automotive
companies are working on self driving cars.

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:03.650
And this is a technology some people believe
it might be with this by the year 2020. Time

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.690
will tell. But I believe, this is the next robot technology we all encounter on an everyday basis.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.400
So, why robots? What's the big picture reason
for having robots in the world? And I think

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.939
if you look at the big problems that our planet
faces right now, come primarily from population

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:32.319
growth. If we look what population growth
is going to do over the coming decades, what

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.449
you can see on this slide here is a prediction
of robot population. And by the year 2020,

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.340
its believed that there will be a hundred
million robots at work on the planet.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.710
Now, not all of these are going to be the
classic manufacturing robots. Many of them

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.699
are going to be for instance robot cars, or
robot vacuum cleaners, perhaps robot gardeners,

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.879
robot maids, who knows what. But this is the
sort of new class of robot that's emerging

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.030
and the number of these is just going to increase,
perhaps exponentially.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.500
What I want to do now is talk about the big
picture reasons why I believe that we need

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:17.199
robots. This picture illustrates some of the
big problems that are facing society now,

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.889
and increasingly in coming decades. The problems
that we face are due to increased human population

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.020
on the planet. There are more people in the
planet. It means, we need to provide more

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.210
food. This is going to require more transport
requirement. There's going to be more cars

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.460
on the road, more people, more things going
from one place to another. And this population

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.039
of ours gets older there's going to be a need
for more health care.

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:49.479
As the population get's older, we are going
to have an imbalance in the age ratios. There's

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.520
going to be more older people and less younger
people to support them. And this is a problem

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.409
that is confronting almost country on the
planet today. And it is very profound problem.

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.430
I think we don't really have handle, a good
solution, on what we are going to do about

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.819
that. But I believe the robots can play an
important role here.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.180
The other problem that we are facing is climate
change. As the climate of our planet changes,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.669
it's going to have real impacts on where people
are able to live where the amount of water

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:27.599
that would be available, and the amount of
food that we can produce. So, very big picture

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:34.280
problems, very complex and all interrelated.
And I believe that robots can play a very

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.979
positive role in ameliorating some of these
problems. And that's what I want to talk about

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.110
in this particular lecture.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.849
The other thing that I want to talk about
in this lecture, and I think it's an important

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:50.360
one, is the ethical considerations around
robotics. Now, I'm not an ethicist, I'm a

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.330
roboticist. And I’m going to talk to an
ethicist later in this lecture and just try

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.939
and unpack what are some of the issues about
ethics that apply to robotics.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.080
We are going to have a discussion, we’re
going to do a bit of an ethics 101, learn

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.620
some fundamental principles of ethics, and
then look at issues such as; is it appropriate

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.039
for robots to look after elderly people or
young people; what are the ethical issues

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:19.999
with robots driving cars on our roads; what
are the issues around invasion of privacy;

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:24.770
what about robots in jobs. Every time I give
a talk about robots, somebody asks the question,

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.770
"Aren’t robots going to take away jobs?"
I don't think it’s that simple.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.270
And in this lecture, we’d like to unpack
some of these issues, talk about them at length.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.240
At least give you something to think about,
argue about. I think it's important that we

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.169
have this particular conversation.
