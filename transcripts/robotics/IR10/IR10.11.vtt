00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.550
We've covered a lot of territory in this lecture,
let's recap some of the more important points.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.580
Actuators is a device that causes motion that
can cause linear or rotary motion, and they

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.439
can generate either a speed or a force. They
can be based on a number of different physical

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.439
principles; they can be hydraulic, pneumatic,
or electric.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.769
In most robots, electric is the most common
type of actuator that's used. Most robots

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.609
driven by electric motors employ a reduction
gear box. Electric motors are capable of spinning

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.990
very very quickly, but they tend to have relatively
low torque. A reduction gearbox amplifies

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.270
the motor's torque at the expense of the motor's
speed. We introduced "S" as an operator to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.960
convert a differential equation into an algebraic
equation, a characteristic equation, which

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.440
represents the dynamics of an underlying mechanical
or electrical system. The roots of the characteristic

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.710
equation are referred to as the poles of the
system. And they describe the response of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.590
the system as a function of time.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.560
For a system with multiple poles, the overall
response is the super position of the response,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.640
due to each of the individual poles.
We introduced the notion of a transfer function.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.230
And in the laplace domain it is the ratio
of resistance output to it's input.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.900
Most mechanical systems incorporate friction.
There are two important classes of friction:

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.860
linear friction, and non-linear friction which
is sometimes referred to as coulomb friction.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.310
A realistic friction model looks something
like this. It has a positive and negative

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.870
coulomb friction value and a linear slope
"B".

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.950
The friction force always opposes the direction
of motion. And a friction characteristic like

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.010
this is not defined for the case of zero velocity.
For a current controlled electrical motor,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.060
we can write its transfer function in terms
of the motor constant, it's inertia, and it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.150
friction.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.220
A motor control system needs a means of measuring
the angle of the motor shaft. And the most

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.159
common way this is done is with an incremental
encoder with two light beams shine through

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.540
slots in a disk attached to the motor shaft.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.720
We can analyze these signals to determine
the velocity of the motor and the direction

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.770
of rotation. And by counting the pulses and
knowing the direction, we can determine the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.840
angle of the motor shaft. We bring a number
of these components together to create a robot

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.290
joint controller.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.860
The joint controller itself is typically an
algorithm running in an embedded controller.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.020
The motor drive is typically an H-bridge circuit
comprising four electronic switches. The switches

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.260
can be turned on and off very quickly which
allows us to control not only the direction

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.190
the current flows through the motor, but the
average voltage that the motor experiences.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.099
The output of the motor is connected through
the robot joint by a mechanical transmission,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.730
a reduction gearbox which amplifies the torque
of the motor.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.380
The position of the motor is measured with
a position sensor. Typically, that's an optical

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.170
incremental encoder. That information is fed
back to the joint controller compared with

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.930
the desired position. And the error between
those two is used to drive the motor either

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.300
forwards or backwards to minimize the error.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.810
We can create a dynamic model of this robot
joint control system.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.260
We have a block which represents the joint
controller, and the negative feedback summing

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.430
junction. The output of the motor driver is
current which goes into our model of the actuator.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.290
The output of that block is the position of
the motor. We model the sensor as a gain of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.060
one, which provides the negative feedback
signal to the joint controller.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.920
The maximum acceleration of a robot joint
is a function of the maximum torque that the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.790
motor can generate and that's a function of
the motor torque constant and the maximum

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.319
current that can be fed into the motor. And
it's also a function of the inertia that the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.170
motor experiences.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.349
That inertia has got two components: one component
is the motor's own armature inertia and that's

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.870
a constant. The other component is the inertia
of the link.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.300
In a real robot, the link inertia is highly
variable. And that's because in a serial link

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.459
manipulator, each link has to hold up all
of the subsequent links. As the joint angles

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.739
of all of those out board links varies with
time, so will the inertia that this motor experiences.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.699
However, typically there is a gearbox between
the motor and the link and that is the effect

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.540
of reducing the inertia of the link by a factor
of "G" squared. Typically, "G" is a big number,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.280
could be ten, could be a hundred; and that
dramatically reduces this variable inertia

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.630
due to the link configuration.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.810
Multi-joint robots typically employ what's
called independent joint control so there

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.699
is a separate robot joint controller for each
individual joint. Typically these controllers

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.229
have a common electronic and software design.
And typically, only a few parameters in the

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.810
joint controller need to be changed to accommodate
the different sized motors that are fitted

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.830
to different joints of the robot.
