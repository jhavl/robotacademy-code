00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.289
Let's look at some practical issues now and
one of these is reachability. Our robot has

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:14.410
only got finite links. So, there are a large
number of possible goal locations that the

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.119
robot is physically just not going to be able
to reach. If the point is unreachable then,

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.830
it will generally lead to some problem in
our inverse kinematics solution. A numerical

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.670
algorithm will fail to converge.
For an analytic approach, we may end up finding

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.489
that we're computing the square root of a
negative number or we may find that we're

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.079
computing the inverse cos sign of a number
whose magnitude is greater than 1.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.069
Some numerical problem will crop up in our
inverse kinematics. Another problem is a singularity

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.979
and this has got a lot of similarities to
the Gimbal lock problem that we looked at

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.069
much earlier.
Here, we can see the wrist of a Prima 560

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:03.600
robot and we can see that in this particular
configuration, the axis of the 4th joint is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.700
parallel to the axis of the 6th joint. It
would be now animate this robot and look what

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.620
happens when we move joint 4 of the robot.
The whole wrist assembly moves like this and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.830
now we're going to move joint 6 of the robot.
We see that it causes exactly the same sort

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.390
of motion of the end effector. Now, what we're
going to do is to counter rotate joints 4

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.750
and joint 6 so if joint 4 is increasing, joint
6 is decreasing, net result being that the

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.750
end factor does not move at all.
So, just as in Gimbal Lock case, we've lost

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.200
the decree of freedom. Joint 4 and joint 6
result in exactly the same motion that the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.050
robots end effector and in robotics, we refer
to this as a singularity.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.600
What it means in practical sense is if the
axis of joints 4 and joint 6 are aligned like

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.960
this then it's not possible for the robot
end effector to adopt some particular orientations.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.560
In order to break that alignment, to move
out of singularity, it's important that the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.840
5th joint angle theta 5 is set to some value
that's not equal to 0.
