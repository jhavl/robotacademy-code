00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.750
We are now going to consider an object which
moves in three-dimensional space, for instance

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.240
this airplane but it could be a flying robot,
it could be an underwater robot.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.809
I want to describe its position within the
world.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.480
And we are going to use the same process that
we did for two dimensions.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.820
We’re going to introduce a reference coordinate
frame.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.270
Now, for the three-dimensional case, this
is a three-dimensional coordinate frame.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.470
It’s got an x-axis, a y-axis and a z-axis.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.750
And, I’m going to put it at an arbitrary
place in the world and that is going to be

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.570
our reference coordinate frame.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.739
In three dimensions, we used a coordinate
frame that looks like this and there are a

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.489
lot of similarities to the 2D coordinate frame
we looked at in the last lecture.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.079
There are three axes.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.110
They are x, y and z and they meet at angles
of 90 degrees to each other.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.780
The point where they all intersect is referred
to as the origin.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.409
So, these three axes together form what we
call a three-dimensional coordinate frame.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.400
Let’s introduce a point now and we want
to describe the point with respect to the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.450
3D coordinate frame.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.460
We do this by dropping a line down to the
XY plane and measuring the displacement A

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.469
along the x-axis, the displacement B along
the y-axis and the displacement C along the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.469
z-axis.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.250
So, we can represent the point by three numbers.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.979
We call this a tuple, a 3-tuple, and that’s
basically a group of three numbers, the numbers

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.110
A, B and C and they are the coordinates of
the point.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.930
So, we can consider a point is a location
in an n-dimensional space.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.119
A mathematician would write that as P belonging
to the set of real numbers to the power of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.119
n.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.890
And in this particular case, n is equal to
three.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.759
In the most general sense, we can represent
the coordinate as a group or a tuple of n

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.759
numbers.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.409
Again, in this case, n equals three, so it
represents a point by a coordinate which comprises

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.720
three numbers.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880
We can describe a vector in terms of three
components: a component A parallel to the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.399
x-axis, component B parallel to the y-axis,
and a component C parallel to the z-axis.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.360
And, we represent the vector P using the lower
case symbol p and a column vector.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.700
That’s a stack of numbers one above the
other: the distance A, the distance B and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.239
the distance C. A vector is an element of
an n-dimensional vector space.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.480
A mathematician would say that lower case
p belongs to the set of real numbers to the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.610
power of n.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.800
Again, in this case, n equals 3.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.590
We can also represent a vector by an n element
column vector.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.500
That’s n numbers stacked one above the other.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.319
We can consider a vector as a relative displacement.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.909
That’s how we get from the origin, our reference
point, to the point p in a straight line.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.489
All the vectors that we’re going to consider
start at the origin, so we refer to these

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.480
as bound vectors.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.760
They have a particular starting point.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.860
And, that means that the vector shown here
in red is different to this vector shown here

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.600
even though it has got the same length and
the same orientation in space.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.650
Another way we can describe vectors is in
terms of a set of orthogonal unit vectors.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.840
Let’s introduce the unit vectors, x-hat,
y-hat and z-hat.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.240
Now, each of these vectors has got a length
of one and they are parallel to the coordinate

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.780
axes, x, y and z.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.739
Now, we can represent our vector lower case
p in terms of the unit vectors.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.830
A time x-hat, B times y-hat, plus C times
z-hat.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.400
There are some similarities, but some important
differences between points and vectors.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.439
Points define a location.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.810
It’s not possible.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.989
It doesn’t make any sense to add or multiply
points.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.349
Vectors do not define location.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.819
They specify how to get from one location
to another or from one point to another.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.769
Now, we can add and subtract vectors, that
makes perfect sense and we can multiply a

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.800
vector by a scalar.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.400
We can make the vector longer or shorter while
maintaining its direction.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.829
The difference between two points is a vector.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.170
And a point can be defined as a vector with
respect to another point and that point is

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.730
typically the origin of the coordinate frame.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.989
Points and vectors are both represented by
a group of n real numbers.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.800
N, in our case, is three because we’re talking
about three-dimensional space.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.930
A point is typically represented as a row
vector, a list of numbers inside parenthesis,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.310
whereas a vector is typically represented
as a stack of the n numbers one above the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.009
other and typically in square brackets.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.199
Now, I can describe the position of the airplane
with respect to this coordinate system.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.120
I need to define a reference point on the
airplane.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.289
I need to describe one particular location.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.040
So, let’s say the tip of the airplane’s
nose.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.350
Now, I can measure that distance.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.330
Roughly, I’d say it’s about 35 centimetres
in the X direction and it might be something

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.310
like 18 centimetres in the Y direction and
it’s something like 13 centimetres in the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.310
Z direction.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.650
So, I can describe the position of this particular
point in the 3-dimensional world by those

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.530
three numerical coordinates.
