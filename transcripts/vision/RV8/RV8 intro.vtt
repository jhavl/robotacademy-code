In the last lecture we talked about image
formation for pinhole cameras and cameras

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
with lenses and we treated it geometrically.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.769
In this lecture we're going to look at image
formation again but this time we're going

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.590
to treat it more formally, more mathematically.
We're going to use two mathematical tools

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.800
to help us do this. The first is linear algebra
and that's all about matrices and vectors,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.579
a topic you should be quite familiar with.
The second topic is one you are perhaps less

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.550
familiar with and it's homogeneous coordinates.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.250
So we'll introduce homogeneous coordinates
and then we'll use it to help us with a mathematical

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.500
formalism of image formation.
