00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.619
In the last lecture we talked about robot
joint control and that’s the problem of

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.890
how do we control the motor which is actuating
the joint angle in a robot arm.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.449
Now in a real robot, this control problem
is a little bit more complicated than we talked

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.810
about in the last lecture and a pretty simple
example can make that clear.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.419
If you consider in the problem of controlling
my shoulder joint, then the weight of my arm,

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.440
gravity acting on this arm is going to exert
a torque on my shoulder and so the arm is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.290
going to want to fall down, so it’s the
muscles in my arm, have to apply an opposite

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.100
torque in order to keep my arm horizontal.
So, a really important factor in robot arm control

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.920
is the influence of gravity, the weight force
that acts on the various links of a robot’s arm.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.350
Now, another problem is to do with the change
in inertia. The motor, which is driving, for

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.740
instance my shoulder joint sees the inertia
of the motor itself, but it also sees the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.590
inertia of this link, so in order to accelerate
this, going to have to accelerate all this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.399
part of my arm and that requires
additional torque in the motor in order to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.179
achieve a particular acceleration; it’s
a function of the inertia of my arm.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.450
Now, the inertia depends on the configuration
of my arm. My arm here is got maximum inertia

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.969
about the shoulder axis, but if the arm
was in a configuration like this, it’s got

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.100
less inertia. If it was in a configuration
like this, it’s got less inertia still.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.219
So, the configuration of the links outwards
from a particular joint are going to affect

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.569
the inertia that that joint sees. So all of
these sorts of effects, the gravity problem

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.780
and the inertia problem are lumped together
in what we call rigid body dynamic effects

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.240
and that’s what we’re going to talk about
in this particular lecture.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.639
Now, in the last lecture, we put up this block
diagram and we worked our way through all

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.499
the different blocks in the diagram. In this
lecture, what we’re going to do is put the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:10.739
spotlight on the robot joint itself; this is where one joint interacts with the other joints in the robot arm.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.230
This is where the effects like changing gravity
and changing inertia, these are mechanic effects,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.010
come from the robot joint, back through the gearbox and they influence the motor within the robot joint.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.670
So, that’s the purpose of this lecture,
is to try and unpack some of these issues,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.580
see how these gravity problems and the inertia
effects, impact on the individual motors that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.470
are driving the individual joints.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.030
We can’t ignore these effects if we want
to do high quality control of robot joint motion.
