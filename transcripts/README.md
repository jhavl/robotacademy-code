This folder contains the English-language time-coded video transcripts in [VTT format](https://www.simultrans.com/blog/what-is-a-vtt-file#:~:text=VTT%20files%20are%20text%20files,used%20in%20video%20subtitling%20nowadays.).
They were created by a mixture of automatic and human transcription.  They are uploaded to YouTube and provide the optional captions.

The possibility exists to translate these files into different human languages.  One noteworthy [project is to translate the robotics lessons into Portugese](https://github.com/ras-ufcg/CorkeVideos) which is the 9th most popular language in the world.
