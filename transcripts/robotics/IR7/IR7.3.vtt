00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.540
We're going to do a quick recap on the trigonometric
function Tan and its inverse. Nothing on this

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.799
slide so far should surprise you. This is
pretty standard high school maths. We can

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.920
re-arrange it to isolate Tan theta and we
write that in terms of Y divided by X and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.279
then we can introduce the inverse tan function,
so we can write theta in terms of the inverse

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460
tan of Y divided my X.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.050
The inverse tan function is denoted in many
different ways, but most commonly it's written

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.829
as tan to the power of minus one, sometimes
it’s written as A tan and sometimes it's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.160
written as Arc Tan. They're perhaps the most
common ways of representing the inverse tangent

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.359
function. Now let's look at some more complex
cases, but we'll start off with the simplest

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.739
of these cases. And we have a triangle, its
height is one, its width is two and the angle

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.960
marked in the triangle is equal to 0.4636
radiance. If I apply the inverse tan function

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.640
to the ration one over two, then I get exactly
the same value, 0.4636. That's right for the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.600
case where the angle is negative. In this case the width is two but the height is equal to minus one.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.220
I can compute the arc tangent of minus one
divided by two and I get the result which

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.830
is minus 0.4636 just as I would expect. Now
let's consider the case of an angle that's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.480
bigger than Pi on two. In this case the height
is one and the width is equal to minus two.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.300
In this case theta is equal to 2.6779 radiance.
If I compute the arc tangent of one over minus

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.570
two, then I get a result which is minus 0.4636.
We see that there is a discrepancy between

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.500
the actual angle of this line and the angle
that is given to us by the arc tangent function.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.000
And similarly for this case, the width is
minus two, the height is minus one and if

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.980
I compute the arc tangent of that, the result
I get is 0.4636. The problem in this last

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.760
case is that negative one divided by negative
two, gives a result which is the same as one

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.590
divided by two. It's a positive number and
that's the same as the example we did at the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.670
beginning up here.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.950
The underlying problem here is that inverse
tan function has got a range which only spans

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.810
from minus Pi on two to plus Pi on two. To
get around the problem we introduce a new

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.069
function and it's commonly called "A Tan Two",
you’ll find a function of this name in the

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.540
mathematical library of many programming languages
and you’ll certainly find it in MATLAB.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.810
It takes into account the sign of A and the
sign of B and from that information it can

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.859
determine which quadrant of the circle the
angle lies within. So the range of this function

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.280
is from minus Pi to plus Pi inclusive. And
here's a simple example using MATLAB, computing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.530
the arc tangent of one divided by minus two,
it gives us the answer of 2.6779 radiance

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.959
and that's an angle in the second quadrant
of the circle.
