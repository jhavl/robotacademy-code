00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.599
In the previous lecture we introduced the
notion of pose and poses; a way of describing

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.990
both the translation and the orientation of
one coordinate frame with respect to another.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.449
And the notation we used is based on the Greek
letter ksi and we used that to represent pose

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.949
and we used the letter B the subscript to
indicate that we're talking about the pose

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.890
of the coordinate frame B and the leading
index, in this case A, to indicate that the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.670
pose is with respect to coordinate frame A. So we read this symbol as the pose of B with respect to A.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.460
Things are not much different in 3-dimensions,
once again we use this abstract notion of

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.010
pose represented by Greek letter ksi, and
now we represent the translation and orientation

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.320
of one three-dimensional coordinate frame
with respect to another. Later in this lecture

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.390
weâ€™ll talk about concrete implementations
of ksi, what it actually means in terms of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.220
things that you can compute with, but for
now just consider that as an abstract symbol.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.890
The notation is the same as it is for the
2-dimensional case and we read this symbol

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.790
here as being the pose of coordinate frame
B with respect to coordinate frame A. And

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.940
remembering that pose has got two components,
a translational component; that's the distance

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.710
between the origins of frame A and frame B,
and a rotational component; how do I rotate

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.790
coordinate frame A so that its axes are parallel
to the axes of coordinate frame B.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.630
In 3-dimensions it is not as simple to describe
the orientation of an object. Consider this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.780
airplane. There are a number of ways in which
it can move. It can pitch up and down, it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.510
can roll to the right or it can roll to the
left, and it can yaw to the right or to the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.930
left. So there are number of parameters that
describe the orientation of this body in space.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.340
So the way that we are going to formalise
this is again similar to what we did for the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.979
2-dimensional case, and again we attach a
coordinate frame to the aircraft.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.980
Another coordinate frame here, a blue one
and I'm going to fix it to the aircraft with

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.860
the x-axis pointing forward and that means
that the y-axis points over the wing and the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.700
z-axis points upward. So now when it comes
to describing the pose of this aircraft it's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.200
got a translational component, that's the
position of the origin of this coordinate

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.600
frame with respect to the origin of this coordinate
frame, and then there is the orientation of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.660
this coordinate frame with respect to this
coordinate frame.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.970
The direction of the positive rotation is
an important concept, and in a 2-dimensional

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.870
case rotation was defined as being positive
in this direction. If we consider a 2-dimensional

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.950
coordinate frame, then if we grow a z-axis
out of the screen, that is the equivalent

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.600
right handed 3-dimensional coordinate frame.
So this positive angle convention in two dimensions

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.010
corresponds to a positive rotation about the
z-axis which is coming at us out of the screen.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.240
When we are talking about rotations around
axes we define the direction of positive rotation

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.630
again using a right hand rule. So I take my
right hand and I point my thumb along the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
axis - in this case it's the z-axis, and I
curl my fingers around, and the direction

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.330
of the curl, the direction of the tip of my
fingers is the positive direction. So this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.190
is a positive rotation around the z-axis.
Similarly a rotation around the x-axis - this

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.250
a positive rotation around the x-axis and
this is a positive rotation around the y-axis.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.819
When we looked previously at the 2-dimensional
coordinate frame we also had a rule for the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.980
direction of positive rotation in two dimensions.
Here's our 2-dimensional coordinate frame

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.430
again, here is our x and y-axis lying on top.
So what we defined as a positive rotation

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.319
for a 2-dimensional coordinate frame is actually
a positive rotation around the z-axis, if

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.770
you could imagine a z-axis being there.
In robotics, as in many other areas of engineering,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.370
it's really useful and important to attach
coordinate frames to objects. Now here is

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.090
an example of a helicopter in flight and where
we can attach a right-handed coordinate frame;

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.129
x-axis pointing forward, a y-axis out to the
right, and a z-axis going straight down. Once

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.990
we have a coordinate frame attached to the
vehicle, we can then describe its orientation

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.900
with respect to another coordinate frame.
We can also describe its motion with respect

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.069
to this particular coordinate frame. Forward
is in the x direction, down is in its z direction

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.330
and so on. In the example of an industrial
arm type robot, we might have a 3-dimensional

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.490
coordinate frame attached to the base of the
robot to indicate where it is with respect

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.650
to the world coordinate frame of the factory
and we will attach another 3D coordinate frame

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.270
to the gripper, and by convention the z-axis
points outward in the directions of the fingers,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.509
the direction that it might approach an object
for describing a pick up. The y-axis by convention

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.949
is the direction between the finger tips, then
we draw in the x-axis so as to create a proper

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.900
right-handed 3-dimensional coordinate frame.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.969
If we look into the details of very famous
engineering projects like the Apollo Lunar

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.759
Missions, and we look at some of the documentations
which are all available online and here we

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.889
can see the x, y and z axis for the Apollo
command module. And similarly for the Lunar

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.240
module the documentation shows that the x-axis
is vertically upwards and the z axis is forward

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.879
in the direction of the front door. This is
a picture of the massive Saturn V rocket which

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.620
got the astronauts to the moon and back, and again
if we look at the documentation carefully,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.539
we can see that the axes for the early stages
of the rocket are clearly indicated. Some of the

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.400
coordinate frame conventions are actually
painted on the outside of the rocket, and

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.029
if we look closely at this black ring up here
what's called the instrumentation module,

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.089
which in the flesh is actually quite a massive
device, we can see quite clearly here is painted

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.839
the direction of the positive z direction
and the one at the back we can see the direction

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:22.490
of its negative y-axis. This module is effectively
the inertial measurement unit for the Saturn

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.109
V rocket, functionality now is probably equivalent
to what you have in the phone in your pocket.
