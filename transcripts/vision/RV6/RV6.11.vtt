00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.950
Let’s recap some of the main concepts we
have covered in this particular lecture. We

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.190
want to explain where the idea of color comes
from and it’s a multi-step process.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.950
The first step in the process is the illuminant;
that is the object that emits light which

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.380
falls onto the scene. That incoming light
we refer to as illuminance and it’s kind

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.550
of a spectrum; it is a function of the wavelength
and we refer to it by the letter E. That light

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.180
falls onto an object, and the object has got
a reflectance which is also a functional wavelength,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.109
so a red object reflects more red light and
other sorts of light. A blue object would

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.030
reflect more blue light then other kinds of
light. The light that leaves the object we

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.190
refer to as the luminance, the luminance of
the object, and the spectrum of the luminance

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.469
is a function of the spectrum of the illuminance,
the incoming light and the reflectance of

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.469
the object.
That light enters the eye of an observer,

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.630
and within the observer at the back of the
observer’s eye are a number of different

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.580
light sensitive cells—they have different
responses and they respond to different parts

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.450
of the spectrum. The response of theses cone
cells is denoted by N and it is a function

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.680
of lambda. The different cone cells have got
different Ns. The overall response of the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.220
cone cell is the integral over the wavelength
of the spectrum of the incoming light, the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.760
reflectance of the object, and the response
of the individual cone cell. Within the cone

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.790
cell the photons are converted via a chemical
reaction to electrical impulses which travel

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.870
through to visual cortex of the observer,
and they result in a sensation that we have

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.050
learned to associate with the word red.
There are many sources of light and we have

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.360
touched on some of these. Incandescence is
the light admitted by hot objects that could

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.550
be the white hot filament of a tungsten light
bulb or it could be the sun. Other sources

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.200
of light are electron stimulation as occurs
in old fashion cathode ray tubes, light admitting

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.640
diodes, compact fluorescent tubes and other
gas discharged tubes and lasers. Each of these

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.260
has a different luminance spectrum. Light
is a form of electromagnetic radiation and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.629
this radiation varies in terms of its wavelength.
With our eyes we are only able to see that

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.170
part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but
with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.310
a lot of light omitted by common light sources—particularly
the sun and incandescent light bulbs—is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.459
in the infra-red part of the spectrum, and
although we can’t see

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.819
infra-red we can feel it. We can sense it
as heat.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.799
In the retina of our eyes we have a large
number of light sensitive cells: there are

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.299
rod cells and cone cells. Now it is the cone
cells that give us our sense of color vision.

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.389
There are three different types of cone cells:
those that are sensitive to red, those that

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.999
are sensitive to green and those that are
sensitive to blue. Often times they are referred

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:16.120
to as the short, medium and long wavelength
cones. The cones have somewhat overlapping

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.230
response functions; in particular, the red
and green cones are significantly overlapped.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.779
The fact that we have three types of cones
means that we are called trichromats—we

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:32.019
have three-color vision. Not all animals have
three-color vision; most mammals only have

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.219
two-color vision. We call them dichromats.
Many other animals have four-color vision.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.120
We call them tetrachromats and birds are a
typical example of that.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.540
When we create cameras, we borrow a lot of
these principles; we have an underlying array

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.419
of silicone photo sensors and each of those
are sensitive to a wide range of colors.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.029
To make them color sensitive we print color
filters on top of them and generally in a

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:02.269
2 by 2 array which we refer to as the Bayer
pattern, so each 2 by 2 array contains two

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.930
green filters and a red filter and a blue
filter. So we create in silicone an analogue

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.799
of the color sensing mechanism in the human
eye.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.609
If I look at an object with a particular color
and I change the intensity of the illumination

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.220
the appearance of the object will change,
and here we see examples of the object at

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.560
100%, 75%, 50% and 0% brightness. The RGB
values are changing, but the color of the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.780
object itself does not change, so we want
to find a way to disentangle color from intensity.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.770
To map the three what we call tristimulus
values—that is, the red, green and blue

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.229
value into a brightness value and two color
values—now we can do this very simply by

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.400
converting the RGB values to what we call
chromaticity coordinates, indicated by the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.440
lower case r, g and b. Now these three numbers
are actually redundant. I can compute any

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.310
one of them given the other two, so we only
need to use two of them and typically we keep

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.379
only R and G, these numbers vary between zero
and one.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.680
So if we make a graph where on the horizontal
axis we have the r coordinate, on the vertical

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.380
axis we have the g coordinate, then every
possible color appears within this triangle

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.080
… pure red appears here, pure green appears
here, pure blue appears here, and it is not

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.780
possible for any colors to exist above the
blue line.
