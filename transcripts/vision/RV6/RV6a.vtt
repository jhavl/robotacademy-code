00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.880
The last part of the process is what goes
on in the eyes of the observer.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.929
We refer to this as the response and like
everything else the response is a function

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.180
of the wavelength lambda.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.190
In fact the response can be written this way:
it is the integral over wavelengths of the

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:28.439
spectrum of the incoming light of the reflectance
and of the response of the eye to light at

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.220
that particular wavelength.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.410
So what we sense in the photoreceptor cells
in the back of our eye is essentially the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.790
result of this particular integral.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.940
Let’s see how that works.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.290
Here is a cut away diagram of the human eye;
at the back of the eye we have the retina

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.940
and we are looking at the surface of the retina;
we see a lot of blood vessels and we can see

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.399
the optic nerve, which is what connects the
eye to our brain.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.539
If we take a cross section through the retina,
make a slice through there, we look downwards.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.180
We see that there are layers of nerves and
other sorts of cells.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.200
And at the bottom of this stack we have the
light sensitive cells and they look something

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.430
like this.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.880
So what is quite surprising is that the light
sensitive cells are not on the surface of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
the retina.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.080
They are actually about 500 micrometers below
the surface of the retina.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.820
So the light that falls on the retina has
to fight its way down through blood vessels

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.970
and nerve cells and all sorts of things to
get to the light sensitive rod and cone cells.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880
Let’s look at the rod cells.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.000
They’re these small worm-shaped objects
that we see in the back of the retina.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
They contain a chemical called rhodopsin.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.210
And it is a quite important chemical, because
when a photon of light hits it, it changes

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.680
its shape, and changes its shape from this,
to that.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.659
And we can see that one arm of the molecule
is in fact being spun around by the impact

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.820
of the photon and that is eventually converted
into an electrical signal, which travels along

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
the optical nerve to the visual cortex of
your brain.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.290
The rod cells are very sensitive to light,
so these are the cells we use in low light

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.290
conditions.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.340
This is what we use at night, and the way
they are wired makes them also very sensitive

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.230
to motion and it is what we use to determine
that something is moving in the edge of our

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.570
field of view.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.900
The rod cells are sensitive to a range of
electromagnetic radiation as shown by this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.150
graph here.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.690
So this is the response curve of the rod cells
and we denote it by the symbol M and it, of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.720
course, is a function of wavelength lambda.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.160
The rod cells are maximally responsive to
light at 498 nanometers.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.620
Basically, mid green color.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.460
The other very important class of cells in
the human eye are the cone cells, and one

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.959
of them is indicated here.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.239
They are not that conical.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.770
They are certainly fatter at the bottom then
they are at the top.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.540
Quite a different shape to the rod cells.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.790
The cone cells contain chemicals called photopsins;
they are related to rhodopsin that we have

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.200
in the rod cells.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.560
There are different flavours of photopsins
that are sensitive to light at different colors.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.879
The cone cells are what we use for our everyday
daytime activities and in the daytime we use

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.470
our cone cells, not the rod cells.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.360
The cone cells contain a chemical called photopsin
and photopsin is related to rhodopsin, but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.360
there are three different flavours of the
photopsins, there are photopsins that are

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.239
sensitive to red, to green and to blue light
and so there are three different types of

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.590
cones, those that are, that contain these
different types of photopsin, sensitive to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.379
red, green and blue.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.660
So we say that human beings are trichromats.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.659
It means that we have got cells that can sense
three different colors, sensitive to different

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.459
bands within the spectrum and that is what
is shown in the graph over here.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.489
Often these bands are referred to by the letters
S, M and L, which stand for short wavelength,

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.650
medium wavelength and long wavelength.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.830
We would also refer them as blue, green and
red … in that order.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.680
The response of the short, medium and long
cone cells are shown here.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.519
We can see that there is quite some overlap,
particularly between the medium and long wavelength

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.700
cone cells, and also shown here for reference
is the response of the rod cells we looked

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.460
at in the previous slide.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.990
Let’s look more closely at the retina and
there are two key landmarks in the retina.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.650
One is what we call the fovea, where we have
an enormous concentration of light sensitive

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.960
cells.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.669
The other big landmark which is where the
optic nerve joins the retina, and that area

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.590
has almost no light sensitive cells—it is
actually a blind spot in your eye.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:56.000
So if we project those two points down and
we draw an axis, we can plot the concentration,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.750
the density of cone cells as a function of
angle away from the fovea.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.410
So on one side we have the direction towards
your ear, on the other side we have the direction

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.039
towards your nose and we can see there is
an enormous concentration of cones in the

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.449
fovea area and a much lower concentration
of cone cells in the rest of your eye in what

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.740
we call the peripheral vision area.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.650
If we look now at the distribution of rod
cells we see almost the converse; we see that

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.650
there are very many rod cells in the peripheral
parts of your vision, not too many of them

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.130
at all in your fovea.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.400
So the fovea, we have a very high concentration
of color sensitive cells, the rest of the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.509
eye there are a large number of cells that
are sensitive to light but don’t distinguish

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.170
between different colors.
