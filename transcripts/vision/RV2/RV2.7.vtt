Another really important source of visual
information are movie files. The tool box

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.529
that you have been using ships with a large
number of images and also smaller number of

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.590
movies.
So let’s scroll through the provided images,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.260
and some of them are familiar ones that you
have either seen already or will see later

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.270
during this course, and right down the bottom
here there is a movie file, we know it is

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.800
a movie file because it has got an extension
of .MPG, short for MPEG. And we will talk

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.629
a little bit about that shortly.
Let me double click on this movie file and

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.050
it comes up in a movie player. It is not a
brilliantly exciting movie; it is a view from

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.649
a window looking down on an urban intersection,
with cars and trucks. It is in black and white,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.460
and it runs for only a very short amount of
time.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.819
So what we are going to do now is to read
some frames from that movie sequence into

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:03.920
the MATLAB workspace. I am going to do that
by creating a movie camera object. This is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.500
related to the camera object we looked at
before, but this particular movie object is

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.940
of the class movie.
We are going to give it the name of the file

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:22.820
that contains the movie, traffic_sequence.mpg.
Open that up and it creates a new movie object

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.360
in our workspace. Now we can grab frames from
this movie, by using the grab method, just

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.350
as we have done for the other camera objects
we have seen before. What that does is grab

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.820
the first frame from the movie and display
it in a window. I can get the next frame.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.020
And the next frame, the next frame, and so on.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.320
If we display the movie object just by typing
in the name and return, it gives us some information

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.350
about the movie. It tells us the size of the
individual frames, that they are 720 columns

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.570
wide, 576 rows high. The movie is recorded
at 30 frames per second and there’s a total

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.060
of 351 frames in this movie, for a run time
of 11.7 seconds.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.810
Movie file formats have got a lot in common
with the image file formats that we looked

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.069
at a little while ago. They comprise a container
which holds a number of objects, the first

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.879
object is the header which says something
about the size of each frame within the movie

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.139
and the format in which the audio and video
is encoded.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.840
Often times we refer to what is called a video
codec and that is short hand for the compression

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.700
algorithm that is applied to the image frames
within the movie. And there is also an audio

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.349
codec, which is the algorithm which compresses
the audio information.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.650
There is also some metadata associated with
the movie. It might have the type of camera,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.769
the camera settings and again the location
at which the movie was taken. The bulk of

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.419
the file though is occupied with the frames
of the movie, which are compressed using a

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:11.900
video codec, and the audio data which is compressed
using the audio codec. So we need to specify

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.079
the format of the container as well as the
format of the movie data and the audio data.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.249
So when we refer to something like an mpeg4
movie, to be more precise, what we are talking

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:31.599
about is an mpeg4, part fourteen container.
That means it is defined by a standard, part

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.609
of the mpeg4 standard, part fourteen of that
standard. And the video is compressed using

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.559
the H.264 standard, and the audio is compressed
using the AAC standard. So mpeg4 is a short

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.249
hand for a lot more detail about the container,
the video and the audio.

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:55.599
And just as with image file formats, there’s
a bunch of movie formats that are commonly

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.540
used today and some of them are container
formats, some of them are codec formats and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.749
some of them specify the container and the
codec.
