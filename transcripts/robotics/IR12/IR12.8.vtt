00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.670
In this section, I would like to talk about
fear of Robots. As roboticists we might have

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.959
a different perception or view of robots to
the general population. We believe that robots

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.440
are fun and cool in the future but perhaps
not everybody shares that view. I particularly

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.390
like this advertisement, was for Dodge Charger
and it came out in 2013. I can’t show you

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.420
all of the video here but the advertisement
is exploiting a general unease in the population

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.500
about the future of robots and suggesting
that we wouldn't want a self-driving car that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.640
is going to end very, very badly for human
kind.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.950
But then, there are dancing robots and everybody
seems to love dancing humanoid robots so here

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.360
we see three simple humanoid robots doing
some choreographed dancing. So this is a kind

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.680
of robot that generally doesn't invoke fear
and loathing in the general population.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.960
And then there are robotic movie characters
such as Wall-e and Eve, which are quite non-threatening,

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.049
and in fact, quite endearing.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.229
In contrast with robots like this from the
Terminator franchise which are actually quite

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.770
scary and intimidating. Here we have a scene
with a large number of robots; these robots

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.529
here individually look quite benign, they
look quite human like, they have got nice

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.590
gentle facial expressions but personally,
I find this scene rather unsettling and I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.189
think it is the fact that it is not just one
robot but it is the fact that there is row

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.319
upon row upon row of robots, which I find
unsettling. Perhaps, also because all these

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.499
robots look exactly the same.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.299
Here is a very famous robotics researcher
with his robotic clone. Some people may have

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.459
absolutely no problem with an image like this
but other people might find such a scene rather unsettling.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.679
That leads us to a phenomena which is called
the Uncanny Valley. The Uncanny Valley is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.889
represented by this graph here and on the
horizontal access we have an indication of

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.880
how life-like the robot is.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.520
We can go from being not life-like at all
to completely life-like

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.000
and in the vertical axis we have upwards that we find the robot attractive

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.040
and downwards we find the robots to be repulsive.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.550
Now, the notion of the Uncanny Valley was
first hypothesized by Professor Mori and I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.350
had the delightful opportunity to meet him
at IROS conference in 2013.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.660
So if we consider the Uncanny Valley hypothesis,
what we see is that as the likeness to a human

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.910
being increases, we find the robot to be more
and more attractive. But at a certain point,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.030
we then find that as it becomes more life-like
we find it to become less attractive, perhaps

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.710
even to become repulsive. Now as it becomes
more life-like still, it becomes, again, attractive to us.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.620
And this effect is exaggerated if the robot
is moving. Here is a very simplistic humanoid

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.270
robot. It doesn’t look much like a human
at all. It’s got some sort of face, it’s

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.660
got what look like eyes and a mouth and most
people have no problem with a robot like this.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.490
It is kind of cute; it is a little bit retro.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.150
If we had a robot that looks like this, looks
very, very life-like, most of us would find

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.030
that quite attractive as well. But if we have
a robot that looks not quite right, something

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.600
a little bit off, maybe it is something in
the eyes are not right, the facial expression

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.670
is not quite right, we find a robot like this
to be actually quite repellent. This is the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.850
interesting affect which is called the Uncanny
Valley.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.900
So what I would like to do now, is to speculate
a little bit about where this fear of robots

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.500
might come from, particularly the fear of
robots in human form. I believe a lot of it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.940
is down to cultural baggage and particularly
in the western Judeo Christian culture; there

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.500
are probably echoes of the ancient Jewish
legend of the Golem. The Golem was a human-like

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.730
creature fashioned from clay by a Holy man.
The Golem would serve its creators and protect

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.160
them but occasionally they would run amok
and cause great havoc and damage. So the Golem

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.529
was a mixed blessing, it could do good but
it could also do bad.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.460
A more recent influence in western culture,
I believe, comes from the story of Frankenstein,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.439
Mary Shelly’s 1818 novel, in which the creature
turns on its creator Dr. Frankenstein and

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:39.830
this story of the creation turning on the
creator is the foundation for many, many of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.569
the robot stories that we read today in science
fiction books and in science fiction movies.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.370
Talking to friends and colleagues in Japan,
I get a sense that they are less fearful,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.639
less intimidated by machines built in human
form. I am going out on a bit of a limb here,

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.229
but I think the difference is in the cultural
baggage; they haven't grown up with the cultural

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:10.279
tradition of the Golem or the cultural tradition
of the Frankenstein story. I think, in their

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:17.399
religious beliefs they can see a life force in all sorts of objects whether they are animate or inanimate.

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.289
So this is entirely speculation on my part,
but I think it is the difference in the cultural

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.150
heritage of the West and the East that perhaps
makes people from Japan more accommodating

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.779
of robots in humanoid form and at certainly
where the technological push to create humanoid

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:41.139
robots first came from. The West has really been playing catch up when it comes to humanoid robots.
