00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.490
Welcome to week one in the Robotic Vision
Project. My name is Liam O'Sullivan and I'll

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.960
be your guide for the next seven weeks as
to how to complete the Robotic Vision Project.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.010
The first one to six weeks, you'll be getting
a picture of this Robotic Vision worksheet

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.910
into MATLAB and then classifying the 2D objects
which exist on this page, into a particular

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.189
colour, shape and size. This forms the input
to an optional seventh week where you can

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.309
take a robotic arm that you've created, put
it on the Robotic Vision worksheet and then

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.219
actuate to a particular 2D object. Let's take
a look now in MATLAB at what the output of

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.989
the Robotic Vision Project will be.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.100
Alright, so we're in MATLAB here and we're
looking at the output of the project through

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
weeks one through six, so if we look at this
image here, we can see our Robotic Vision

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.140
worksheet, so you guys are going to have to
download this worksheet, which is in PDF format

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.370
and print it out, then we'll take a photo
of it using either our mobile phone camera

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.910
or a webcam and then we'll import it into
MATLAB and then apply some image processing

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.080
techniques to try and find the 2D position
of the coloured shapes on this page.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.360
Now you might be saying to yourself, "Okay
why do I have to bother about image processing,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
I could just get out a ruler and then measure
all the 2D positions of the objects on this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.479
page." Well you could do that, there's nothing
stopping you from doing that; however what

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.049
happens if we change the configuration of
these shapes?

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.020
You know we could move these shapes into any
position on the page and then you would have

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.329
to re-measure the position of where they ended
up.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.439
A smarter and better way would be to rely
on image processing, so write some computer

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.770
vision code that allows you to find the 2D
position of the objects, no matter what configuration

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.000
they are in. So we could change it and then
it would take simply a click of a button and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.259
we could find the position of these objects.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.319
Okay, so that's the goal of the project and what we'll be working on through weeks one through six.
