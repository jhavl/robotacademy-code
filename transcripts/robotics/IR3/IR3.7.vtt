00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.040
Now we're going to talk about one of the more
perplexing elements of rotations in 3D.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.710
I've got three coordinate frames here and
they're all initially parallel to each other.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.669
The x-axes, the y-axes and the z-axes are
all aligned.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm going to pick up the first one, the red
one, and I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.500
around its x-axis.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.810
Positive is in this direction so after rotating
it by 90 degrees in x-axis, it looks like

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
this.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.150
And now I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees
around the y-axis.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.910
So this frame is going to end up looking like
this.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.470
This is its final orientation.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.860
I'm just going to put it down there.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.579
I'm going to pick up the blue frame and I'm
going to do the rotation within the opposite

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.710
order.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.070
First of all, I'm going to rotate it by +90
degrees around the y-axis.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.250
That's the positive direction.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.530
So it's initially going to look like this.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.350
And now I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees
around the x-axis.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
The x-axis is now pointing downwards, that's
the positive rotation direction.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.120
So this is what the final orientation will
look like.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.840
And we can see that these two frames have gotten
very, very different orientations.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.000
So when it comes to doing rotations in three
dimensions, the order in which you do them

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.430
is critically important.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.330
Rotations are not to commutative.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.490
Let's look at the non-commutative nature of
rotation matrix multiplication.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.340
I'm going to have a rotation of 90 degrees
around the x-axis.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.390
And then I'm going to rotate by 90 degrees
around the y-axis.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.610
And the resulting rotation matrix looks like
this.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.430
If I do this in the opposite order, I'll rotate
around the y-axis first, and then I'll rotate

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.880
around the x-axis, by 90 degrees in each case.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.540
I end up with a resulting rotation matrix
which looks like this.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.200
And we can see that these two matrices are
quite different.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.770
When you're multiplying rotation matrices,
the order is critically important.
