00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.859
Summary
Let's recap some of the topics we've covered

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.040
in this lecture. We started by talking about
homogeneous coordinates, a different way to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.379
represent points in a 2 dimensional plane.
We talked about ways to convert Cartesian

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.460
coordinates to homogeneous coordinates and homogeneous coordinates back to Cartesian

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.380
coordinates. Mathematically, lines and points are duals.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.769
This leads to some very nice ways to compute
the intersection points at 2 lines or the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.579
line that is formed by 2 points. We've discussed
a different perspective projection model called

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.270
the Central Projection Model and the key difference
is that the image plane is between the object

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.379
and the origin and it forms an image that
is not inverted.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.050
We can represent this as a matrix modification
using homogeneous coordinates of the world

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.090
point and of the point on the image plane.
In a real digital camera, the image plane

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.320
is a large array of light sensitive elements,
which form the pixels of the resulting image.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.630
We need to deal with the discrete nature of
this image plane, the fact that the coordinates

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.799
are measured in units of pixels rather than
in units of metres. There's also an origin

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.680
shift involved instead of the center of the
image plane, the origin in pixel coordinates

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.630
is in the top left corner and we can introduce
that with a simple linear transformation.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.900
Ultimately, we combine a number of matrix
terms together. The first 2 we refer to as

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.680
the intrinsic parameters of a camera.
They described the camera entirely in terms

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.860
of the dimensions of its pixels, the coordinate
of the principal point and the focal length

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.869
of the lens. These are parameters of the camera
itself. It doesn't matter where the camera

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.649
is or where it's pointing. The intrinsic parameters
are invariant to the location of the camera.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.680
The 3rd matrix in this chain, we refer to
as the extrinsic parameters and they described

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.040
the pose of the camera that is its position
and its orientation with respect to the world's

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.549
coordinate frame. We can combine all these
matrices together into a single 3 by 4 matrix

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.819
which encodes all that information. So, the
projection from the world point to image plane

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.040
point is done simply by a matrix modification
which gives us the homogeneous coordinates

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.400
of the point on the image plane and there
is a simple mapping between those homogeneous

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.599
coordinates and the Cartesian image plane
coordinates which we typically denote by U and V.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.360
This representation is scale invariant. We can multiply  the camera matrix

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.970
by an arbitrary non-zero constant and the projection remains unchanged.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.360
This matrix is often written in a normalized

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.580
form where element C34 is equal to 1. If the points lie on a plane in the world, then we

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.950
can write a different relationship between
the coordinate of the point on the plane and

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.000
the coordinate of the point on the image plane
and we use a 3 by 3 homography matrix to do this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.959
Homography matrix maps points from a plane

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.159
to another plane. We can compute the homography
matrix if we know 4 sets of corresponding

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.220
points between the 2 planes. Corresponding
means that the point P and the point Q refer

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.830
to the same point, the same feature in the
world.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.900
One application of homographies is to compute
perspective rectification. We can compute

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.099
an homography H which maps points from point
P in 1 image to point Q in another image and

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.090
if we choose H correctly, we can undo the
effect of perspective distortion. Another

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.730
application of homographies is that we can
take a rectangular graphic like this and distort

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.000
it in such a way that it appears to lay perfectly
into a different plane. In this case, the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.780
plane is the surface of the swimming pool.
The final example of how we might be able

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.470
to use an homography is related to the project
part of this course and we can use it to map

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.180
a coordinate in the image plane of the camera
to an XY coordinate of a point on the robots
