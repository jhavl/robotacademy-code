00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.970
The fundamental physical principle underlying
all electric motors is magnetism. So, let’s

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.090
quickly review what it is we know about magnets.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.910
Every magnet has a south pole and a north
pole, so called because the north pole is attracted

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.590
to the north pole of our planet. If I put
two magnets together like this, we know that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.590
opposite poles attract and like poles repel
each other. Now, let’s imagine we take two

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.269
magnets and lay one on top of the other and
pin them so that the top magnet is free to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:38.879
rotate. Then, what happens is that the similar
poles repel and the top magnet tends to rotate

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.099
so that the north pole in the top magnet is
lying over the south pole of the bottom magnet.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
This is the underlying principle of rotary
electric motors. Let’s re-run the previous

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.440
example and the top magnet, once again, rotates.
And, when it’s nearly at rest, what we do

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.619
is we pull a trick and we reverse the bottom
magnet.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.530
So, now it looks like this. And now, the top
magnet is going to keep rotating so that its

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.510
north pole is attracted to the south pole
and then we pull the same trick again.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.690
So, in this way, we can keep the top magnet
rotating endlessly and this trick is referred

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.280
to as commutation. It’s a fundamental principle
of all electric rotary motors. So, it’s

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.920
a lot like a dog chasing its tail. It’s
never ever going to get to the destination.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.220
When the top magnet gets close to its destination,
we change the destination and we keep doing

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.290
this over and over again.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.290
Here is a picture of the first ever electric
motor. It was invented in 1827 in Hungary.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.480
That’s nearly 200 years ago. Now, the principal
components of this electric motor are, firstly,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.270
the Stator. That’s the stationary electromagnet
that’s highlighted here and it has got the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.570
magnetic field vector indicated in red.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.670
Now, there is another electromagnet and this
one rotates. We call it the rotor and it has

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.310
a magnetic field indicated by the blue vector.
The laws of magnetic attraction and repulsion

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.560
cause the rotor to rotate so that the magnetic
fields are aligned. When the magnetic fields

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.159
are almost aligned, the Commutator reverses
the direction of current flowing through the

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:13.910
rotor electromagnet that reverses the direction
of the magnetic field so the rotor keeps rotating

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.350
to, again, try and align its magnetic field
with that of the Stator and this process is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.620
repeated indefinitely. So, the Commutator
is the key innovation that allows a rotary

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.230
electric motor to operate.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.630
If we look at a modern electric motor, we
see that it has exactly the same components.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.050
It has the stationary electromagnet which
we call the Stator. It has the rotary electromagnet

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.480
which we call the rotor. And, at this end
of the motor, we have the Commutator. Modern

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.060
electric motors are low cost, compact and
reliable. We can consider them as a device

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.180
that converts a current flowing in to the
motor in to a torque applied to the output

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.450
shaft of the motor and this relationship is
linear. An alternative way to consider an

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.250
electric motor is that it is a device that
converts an input voltage to a rotational

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.349
velocity omega that is the speed of rotation
of the output shaft of the motor.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.770
The motors that we have discussed so far are
rotary motors. That is the output is rotary

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.880
motion. But, frequently, in real applications,
we require linear motion, not rotary motion.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.430
There is a couple of ways we can achieve this.
One is to convert rotary motion from a rotary

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.129
electric motor to linear motion using a rack
and pinion mechanism. An alternative is a

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.620
linear electric motor or linear actuator.
And, in this type of device, the shaft moves

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.489
in and out of the body of the actuator, somewhat
like the hydraulic and pneumatic actuators

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.800
that we looked at earlier.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.660
Here is an example of a modern electric motor.
These devices are very effective, very reliable

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.940
and very, very cheap. This is a rotary motor.
So, as I pass current in to these wires here,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.940
the output shaft rotates in either the clockwise
or the anti-clockwise direction.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.030
Here is an example of an integrated motor
and encoder assembly. So, there is a DC motor

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.060
in the front part and this is the output shaft
here. And, on the back is the incremental

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.440
encoder which gives the signal to the controller
about which direction and how fast the motor

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.609
is turning. Here we have an even more integrated
assembly. This has got an electric motor here.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.900
There is a gearbox and here is the incremental
encoder on this end of the assembly. So, this

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.930
is quite a common device in many robots in
mechatronics systems, in integrated motor

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.770
gearbox and encoder assembly.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.949
Finally, here, we have an example of a hobby
class servo motor and this is one of the wheel

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.409
drives from the small robot that I have been
building. This is an even more integrated

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.099
assembly than the last one we looked at. It
contains an electric motor, a gearbox, an

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.689
encoder and a small computer which actually
controls the motor and the motor controls

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.419
signals coming through this, three wire cable
which provides power and also the velocity

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.330
command signal.
