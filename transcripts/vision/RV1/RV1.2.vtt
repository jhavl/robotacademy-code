00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.090
When I was a young person at school they taught
us that we had five senses, but I would argue

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.969
today that they have overlooked a very important
sixth sense, which is the sense of balance.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.230
The sense of balance is absolutely essential
to upright walking animals like human beings,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.070
and we achieve balance using some senses that
are located in our inner ear, in the vestibular

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.529
apparatus where we have the equivalent of
accelerometers and gyroscopes that provide

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.749
the information to keep us upright. Balance is absolutely critical and the human being’s sixth sense.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.940
Other animals have evolved different sensing

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.230
modalities to those the humans have. For instance,
small flying animals like bats have the sense

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.320
of echo location; they send out pulses of
acoustic energy and listen for the reflections

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.990
and they use this when they are flying at
quite high speed at night to find obstacles

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.710
that they would want to avoid and to find
insects that they would wish to eat.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.300
Sharks create an electric field around their
body and then they can sense disturbances

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.960
in their electric field, which are caused
by fish swimming in close proximity to the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.520
shark’s body, and this is really useful
for them in order to detect sources of food.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.120
Finally, pigeons have got an innate sense
of magnetism. They have magnetic senses in

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.780
their heads that allow them to tell where
north is and this is absolutely essential

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.159
for them in their flying long distances, an
essential navigational aid.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.370
Now for us, it’s almost impossible to imagine
what a sense of ‘northness’ feels like,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.700
but pigeons have that sense, so there are
many, many, different senses that animals

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.030
have evolved over time to help them perform
the essential functions of life.
