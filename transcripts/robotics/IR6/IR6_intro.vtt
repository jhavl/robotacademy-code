00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.100
In this lecture, we are going to talk about
robot arms.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.900
In particular, we are going to talk about
the relationship between the joints in a robot's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.250
arm and the pose of the robot end effector.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.550
So as I've moved the various joints in my
own arm we can say that the pose of the end

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.169
of my arm changes, right?

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.710
So what we're going to do is how this works
for a robot arm which typically comprises

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.520
a number of joints.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.489
In a robot's arm, they vary, they have different
numbers of joints, some robot arms might have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.120
only 3 joints, some robot arms might have
6 joints and some might have 10 joints, could have

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.449
a 100 joints.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.800
There are also two different sorts of joints
that robot arms have.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.410
There are joints that are called Prismatic
joints.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.980
These are joints that slide or elongate.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.920
And there are joints that are rotating joints,
like the joints that I have in my own arm.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.260
So we call these sort of rotating joints
Revolute joints and the sliding or telescoping

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.510
joints we called Prismatic joints.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
So here are some pictures of a number of different
types of robot arms that exist.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.330
This is just a very small sample of a very very
large number of robot arms that exist within

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.330
the world.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.000
We are going to work through some of these
examples, look at them, look at the number

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.549
of joints that they have, the different types
of joints that they have and then work on

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.100
the mathematical description, the mathematical
relationship between the joint angles and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.120
the robot end effector pose.
