00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
Let’s have a look at a few different kinds
of robots. The first one we’re going to

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.559
consider is what’s called a Gantry robot
and sometimes called a Cartesian robot. It’s

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.860
a robot that allows us to control the position
of the tool-tip in three-dimensional space,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.009
so we can control the X, Y and Z coordinate
of the tool-tip. The Gantry robot has got

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.430
a boom which moves in the direction indicated
by the blue arrow and the tool moves along

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.050
the boom in the direction shown by the red
arrow. And, finally, the tool itself moves

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.559
up and down in the direction indicated by
the green arrow. We have three motion axes,

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.329
each orthogonal to the others.
This kind of robot is known as a SCARA robot

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.690
and they are widely used in manufacturing
and package handling applications.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.489
The part of the robot that’s highlighted
in red rotates around the axis shown here.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.780
And, the part of the robot that’s highlighted
in blue rotates around this axis. And, finally,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.600
the tool moves up and down along the axis
shown here by the green arrow. Some variants

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.610
of the SCARA robots also rotate the tool around
the axis shown by the green dashed line. The

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.410
term SCARA is an acronym for Selective Compliance
Articulating Robot and so why the complex

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.960
and tortured acronym? But essentially, what
it means is that the robot is quite free to

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.450
move in the horizontal plane, but it’s very,
very stiff in the vertical direction and that’s

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.140
just a consequence of the way it has been
designed and constructed.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.570
A relatively new class of robot is the parallel
link robot and this is an example of one shown

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.420
here. A great advantage of the parallel link
robot is all of the motors can be situated

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.980
in the base of the robot and they are connected
via mechanical linkages to the tool. So, there

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.180
are a number of mechanical linkages in parallel
connecting the tool to the motors. This is

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.890
a very different architecture to the Gantry
robot and the SCARA robot. Those robots are referred

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.280
to as serial link robots because there is
a chain of links from the base to the tool-tip.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.069
Here, the links are all in parallel.
Here are a couple of examples of educational

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.959
robots. The one on the left is a hobby robot
that has got four mechanical joints connecting

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.980
the base to the tool-tip where there is a
parallel jaw or a two-finger gripper.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.439
The Aldebaran NAO robot shown here has got
two arms and two legs. And, each of the arms

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.709
and the legs is essentially a serial link
manipulator. In the case of the arms, there

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.090
are four joints, two at the shoulder, one
at the elbow and one at the wrist, which control

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.659
the position and orientation of the wrist
which holds a number of fingers. And, those

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.079
fingers themselves have got a number of joints
within them.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.069
A very common class of robots have got six
axes, the six-axis serial link robot. On the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.590
left, we can see an example of a state of
the art industrial robot which has got six

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.129
links. And, on the right, we can see a very
unusual example of a six-axis robot. This

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.789
arm is used to load and unload satellites
and other cargo from the shuttle’s payload bay.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.459
Here is a very famous robotic arm in
the history of robot arm development. It was

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.769
developed at Stanford University and it’s
commonly known just as the Stanford Robotic

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.459
Arm. It was developed in 1969. That’s the
year that people first walked on the moon.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.829
What differentiates this robot arm from robot
arms that are very common today is that it

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.719
has got a sliding joint. The third joint in
this robot slides backwards and forwards and

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.760
changes the distance between the robot’s
tool, it’s wrist and the base of the robot.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.469
The first company to produce an industrial
robot was Unimation Inc, a Connecticut-based

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.319
company and they were founded in 1956 and
installed their first industrial robot in

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.959
to a manufacturing plant a couple of years
later. The technology is really quite old.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.320
This is an example of one of those Unimate
robots from 1983. It’s the PUMA 560 robot,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.479
quite a famous robot really in the history
of robotics research. There were many, many

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.500
of these robots actively involved in manufacturing,
but there are also a great number of them

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.400
in university research labs such as learning
how to hack these robots so that they could

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.949
add their own control algorithms to the robot.
So, many, many early robotics research papers

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.889
are all based on these particular PUMA robots,
the PUMA 560.
