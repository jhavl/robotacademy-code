00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.670
In this lecture, what I want to do is talk
about the velocity of the robot's end-effector.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.930
For the last couple of lectures, we have looked
at concepts like forward kinematics and forward

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.590
kinematics is the relationship between the
joint angles and the robot's end-effector

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
pose, so I put in the joint angles and I get
out the end-effector pose.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.750
The inverse kinematics is sort of the opposite.
I say what I want the end-effector pose to

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.440
be and what comes out of the algorithm of
the joint angles that I need in order to achieve

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.200
that end-effector pose.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
The problem, what we are going to talk about
in this particular lecture is velocity transform.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.920
If the joints move at this particular velocity,
what is the velocity of the robot's end-effector

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.950
and you note that I have written the velocity
of the joints as q-dot, so dot represents

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.559
the time rate of change. It is a common notation
in differential calculus and the pose of the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.750
robot's end-effector I have been using this
symbol, psi E, to represent the pose of the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.189
end-effector and we have talked about how
that is combination of position and orientation.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.590
So, in this particular case, what we are talking
about now is cosine dot. We are talking about

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.149
the rate of change of a pose and that is an
interesting and not necessarily intuitive

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.399
thing; so first of all we are going to talk
about what does the rate of change of a pose

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.549
mean, what kind of mathematical object do
we use to represent that and then what is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.240
the relationship between that thing, the psi
dot, and the rate of change of the joint angles

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.639
of the robot itself.

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.950
So, that is what this lecture is about. It
is about understanding relationship between

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.799
velocity of the joints and the rate of change
of pose.
