00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.520
Now it's time to start making these concepts
real. What is this thing? What is this letter ksi?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.480
We're going to do this by separating
rotation and translation.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.390
Here we have the car at two different poses.
And we can describe the second pose in terms

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:27.609
of a relative pose from here to there. Now
in order to aid our understanding and development

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.160
of the concept, we're going to split this
into two parts. A translation followed by

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.730
a rotation. We're going to deal with the rotational
part first because it's actually more complex

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.859
than translation and conceptually more difficult
to understand.
