00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.259
The biggest asset that we have as a species
is our planet and we know that it’s under

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.490
some stress. This very famous graph here shows
the variation in carbon dioxide levels in

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.010
the atmosphere as a function of time. And
we can see that there is an inexorable upward

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.730
trend and that’s going to have all sorts
of consequences for life on this planet. So

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.090
we need to understand how the planet is responding
to all the different stresses that the growing

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.300
human population is placing on it.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.190
During recent times, we become very good at
studying other planets. This is a lovely picture

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.969
that shows a number of the rover vehicles
that NASA has sent to Mars and these rovers

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.929
have made wonderful discoveries about what's
happened on that planet. In particular, they’ve

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.170
pretty much proven the fact that water once
existed on that planet. But what about our

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.690
own planet? Well, on our own planet we have
lots of scientists who spend a lot of their

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.519
time collecting data to try and get an update
on the health of the planet. But collecting

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.080
this kind of data is very, very labour intensive.
And here are some images of scientists collecting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
specimens under water.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.120
One of the problems with the expense of this
manual collection of data is that we can't

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.030
collect very much data. It’s not possible
to collect specimens or make measurements

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.810
at every point on the planet and nor can we
visit those points very often. So the sampling

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.480
that we do, the measurements that we make
are very sparse. We do not visit very many

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.770
places and we do not visit them very often.
The bottom line is that we are under sampling

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.070
the planet and that makes it difficult to
understand some of the underlying biological

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.500
and ecological processes that are occurring.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.660
But what if it wasn't people collecting the
data? What if we sent robots out to do that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.280
instead? And over the years many roboticists
have built robots for exactly this purpose,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.340
for environmental data collection. Here we
have a robotic flying vehicle which can make

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.269
meteorological observations inside extreme
weather systems like cyclones or hurricanes.

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.870
This robot here was develop by Carnegie Mellon
University and has legs and the rapelling

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.330
cable which allows it to descend into the
crater of a volcano to make measurements of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.710
liquids and gases there. Blimps have been
developed to make autonomous environmental

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.680
surveys of large areas of rainforest such
as in the Amazon basin.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.090
This pretty spacey looking underwater vehicle
is use to explore sinkholes in Mexico. The

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.660
Nomad rover was also develop by Carnegie Mellon
University and was used to perform Antarctic

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.900
survey, in particular searching for fallen
meteorites. And the robotic boat here was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.810
develop by colleagues of mine at CSIRO and
performed measurements of water quality over

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.290
the surface of a very large water storage.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.360
A really interesting development is the Argo
float. And this map shows a snapshot of the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.050
Argo floats around the world. These floats
are really very simple robots. They move up

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.330
and down the water column by controlling their
buoyancy. And as they move up and down in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.040
the water column they measure temperature
and salinity and other physical parameters.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.830
They drift in the currents of the ocean. So
they allow us to explore in three dimensions

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.190
what's going on in our oceans. If you're interested
in more information about the floats have

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.020
a look at this URL here. [Note:Replace URL

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.610
Here is an example from colleagues at my University
who interested in the population of these

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.950
gentle creatures called dugongs. Dugongs can
be found all around the world but there's

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.099
a large population of them in Moreton Bay
which is the port just outside my city of Brisbane.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.190
They used an unmanned aerial vehicle with
downward looking cameras to take pictures

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.569
from the air. And then some image processing
techniques to detect and count dugongs within

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.420
the bay. We don't have to send divers down
to find and count the dugongs. We can fly

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.129
over the bay to get automatic measurements
of how many dugongs there are and whereabouts

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.700
in the bay they are.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.410
Now, an unmanned aerial vehicle or flying
robot that does this kind of survey has got

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.879
a limited endurance. It can only be in the
air for a certain amount of time before it

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.129
runs out of fuel. But a lot of researchers
are now starting to look at solar powered

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:24.560
robots. This is a picture of a solar powered
robot, again developed at my University, which

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.600
can stay in the air forever. And people are
looking at solar powered boats and solar powered

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.750
underwater vehicles and solar powered land
robots as well. So this is a technology which

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.370
allows us to put intelligent machines into
the environment where they can persistently

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.130
monitor the state of the planet and send back
lots of measurements taken at frequent intervals

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.379
and covering a large expanse of our planet's
surface.
