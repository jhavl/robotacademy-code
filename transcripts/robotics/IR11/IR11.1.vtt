00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.720
Now, we are going to talk about joint control
with disturbances. And the most obvious disturbance,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.451
the most common disturbance on a robotic arm
is the disturbance due to gravity. Imagine

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:18.359
a PUMA robot manipulator in this particular
configuration. It’s got its arm stretched

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.519
out horizontally and can you imagine that
arm weighs quite a lot. So, there is a large

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.359
torque on the shoulder joint and there’s
also a large torque on the elbow joint that

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.980
are required in order to keep the arm in that
horizontal pose.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.510
We can look at a more simplified version of
that particular scenario. Consider here we

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.480
have an electric motor which is connected
to a horizontal bar. The bar has a centre

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.080
of mass and the centre of mass is a distance
r from the axis of the motor. And the bar

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.010
has got a mass of m and the bar has a weight
force, that’s the force due to gravity acting

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.770
on the centre of mass and that is a force
of mg acting in the downward direction.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.770
Now, a force of mg with a lever arm length
of r results in a torque acting on the motor

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.960
shaft and the magnitude of that torque is
given by the mass times the gravitational

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.810
acceleration times the distance of the centre
of mass from the axis of the motor. In this

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.800
particular case, the torque is acting in a
counter clockwise direction. The centre of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.320
mass wants to move vertically downward. If
we actually do the maths for the case we looked

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.520
at a moment ago, the PUMA robot with its arm
in a horizontal configuration, the torque

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.790
on the shoulder joint is 14 Newton meters.
If I assume that my arm is one meter long,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.450
that’s equivalent to holding four kilograms
with my arm outstretched; that’s a pretty

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.810
difficult thing to do, though there’s a
lot of torque acting on the shoulder joint

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.260
of the PUMA robot. And clearly, this is going
to have an effect on the control of the shoulder

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.010
joint. So, let’s look now in some more detail
at our robot joint controller. And this is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.920
a block diagram we introduced in the last
lecture. It’s a feedback controller. The

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.980
input to the robot joint controller is the
desired position, theta star. And the output

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.640
of the joint controller is the actual joint
position denoted by theta. And as we discussed

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.430
in the last lecture, I’m using the Laplace
transform of many of these variables; so not

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.730
their response in the time domain but their
response in the Laplace domain. And I denote

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.050
the Laplace domain by using capital letters.
So, that’s why I’ve used capital theta

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.310
here and here. Now within this control loop,
we have a control law, it might be a proportional

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.790
derivative controller, it might be a proportional
integral derivative controller known as a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.200
PID controller and we have the gain of the
motor driver and we have the gain of the sensor

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.810
and we have the transfer function of the actuator,
that’s the electric motor which is driving

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.370
the joint. And that has parameters such as
the motor torque constant, KM; the inertia,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.410
J; and the viscous friction, B; and S is of
course the Laplace operator. Now this is a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.150
very idealistic representation. There is no
disturbance such as the force of gravity represented

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.410
in this block diagram. So, let’s do something
about that.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.879
What I’ve done is I’ve moved the motor
torque constant out of the actuator transfer

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.160
function and made it an explicit gain block
which you can see here. The output of that

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.310
gain block is the actual motor torque.
Now what I’ve done is actually separated

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.260
the motor into two components. I have a component
which generates a torque and I have another

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.480
component which represents the inertia and
viscous friction of the motor.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.270
Now, I’m going to introduce another summing
junction which is a where we inject the disturbance

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.410
torque. So at this particular summing junction,
we have the sum of the torque which the motor

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.319
creates and I add to that the torque which
is coming from the disturbance source. It

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.230
might be due to gravity. It might be due to
something like Coulomb friction which we talked

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.769
about in the last lecture and TD is the Laplace
transform of that disturbance torque.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.099
The introduction of a disturbance, even a
constant disturbance, will cause an error

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.060
in the. If we now look a gain at that simplified
schematic, we have the actual angle of the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.030
robot link and we have the desired angle of
the robot link. And we can see that the actual

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.550
angle is a little bit different, it’s downwards
because the force of gravity is pulling it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.830
downwards and the motor controller hasn’t
fully opposed that force of gravity. The controller

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.660
that we just used is a proportional-plus-derivative
controller often known as a PD controller

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.010
and it’s very very commonly used in robotic
systems. So the torque produced by the PD

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.470
controller is a gain P multiplied by the error
between where I want the joint angle to be,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.669
theta star, and the actual joint angle theta
plus another gain termed D multiplied by the

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.630
velocity of the joint that’s theta dot.
If we consider the steady state case where

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.729
the joint is not moving, it’s deflected
downwards by gravity; but it’s not moving

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.180
any further downwards; it’s in equilibrium;
then theta dot will be equal to zero. So,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.030
we can eliminate that term. And if the joint
is in equilibrium, then the torque generated

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.370
by the motor and its controller must be equal
to the torque due to gravity. So, we can write

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.479
this relationship. And if we do a little bit
of rearrangement, we can see that the error

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.030
between where we want the joint to be and
where the joint actually is, is equal to MGR

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.030
divided by P, our proportional gain.
Now, there are some very interesting consequences

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.940
of that. And one is it if we want to reduce
this error, we need to increase the value

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.130
of P. If P is bigger because it’s in the
denominator, then it makes the error much

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.840
much smaller.
We are going to revisit the robot joint model

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.780
that we built in Simulink in the last lecture.
We’ve put the values of some of the parameters

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.009
into the workspace and this is our model and
we’re going to bring in my palette of useful

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.020
Simulink objects as well. The first thing
I’m going to do is to move all of this stuff

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.270
across here and I’m going to introduce a
new gain block which I’m going to drop in

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:11.419
here. And what I’m going to do is to remove
the gain termed KM from the numerator of the

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.840
transfer function and I’m going to put it
into this block here. So functionally, this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.430
is exactly the same. We have a gain KM multiplying
this transfer function here. The output of

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.750
this gain block is the torque that’s applied
to the armature of the electric motor.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.900
Now what I’m going to do is to introduce
a disturbance torque. To do that, I need to

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.169
find a summing junction and there’s a summing
junction and I’m going to edit this so that

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.550
it has got a plus in the upward direction.
I think that will do the trick and I’m going

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:58.120
to remove that wire, put the summing junction
in here, draw a wire from there to there.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:09.990
And the disturbance force is going to come
from a step function, that’s the source.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:18.110
Here we go. And I want my step to occur at
time five in the simulation. The simulation

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.860
runs for 10 seconds, so the disturbance will
occur at five seconds. Hence, it has got a

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.789
value of one.
So, I’m going to connect that into the summing

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:32.480
junction. All right, so what we have now is
a model like what we had before. But now,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.770
I can introduce a disturbance torque which
also acts on the armature of the electric

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.350
motor. There are now two torques acting on the
armature. There is the torque generated by

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.449
the controller and there is the torque by
this external disturbance. Now let’s run

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:54.800
that. I’ll bring the scope into view, so
we can see that, just across a little bit,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.889
and run my simulation. And the result looks
like this. Let’s zoom in a little bit, let's

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:05.789
auto-scale that and we can see that the motor
has been following the square wave moving

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:10.740
between minus one and plus one. But when the
external disturbance is applied, we see that

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.669
that has got a really big influence on the
position of the motor. We could see that it

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:20.460
has moved up and is now moving between the
3-1/2 and 5-1/2. So clearly this external

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.590
force has had a really big impact on the performance
of the motor controller and it’s not doing

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.880
the job that we want it to do.
So, we’ve seen that there are some consequences

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.300
of increasing the proportional gain P. Another
strategy that we can use is to add an integral

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.639
term and that turns our controller into a
proportional integral and derivative controller

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:46.170
very commonly known as a PID controller and
what we’ve added here is the integral term.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.579
We have another gain I which is the integral
gain and that multiplies the time integral

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:57.290
of the position error, theta star minus theta.
What this means, in intuitive terms, is if there

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.350
is a position error, the integral gradually
increases over time and that increases the

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.550
torque that’s applied to the joint so as
to counter that particular error.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.040
Now what we are going to do is to increase
the proportional gain of the system and see

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.550
if we can improve things, so here are the
parameters of our controller. The proportional

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.529
gain is equal to one. I’m going to double
that. I’m going to make it equal to two.

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:26.939
Close that and we’ll run our simulation
again and see what happens to the step response.

00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:33.459
And now we see that the effect of the disturbance
has been attenuated. We can see now that the

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:37.790
effect of the disturbance is less because
we’ve increased the proportional gain.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:44.559
Let’s increase it some more. I’m going
to increase it to a value of four, run that

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:50.879
simulation again. Now we see that the effect
of disturbance is even further reduced, but

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:55.959
we’ve also noticed that the amount over
shoot on our square wave response is much,

00:09:55.959 --> 00:10:01.610
much higher and this is a consequence of increasing
the proportional gain and we can get around

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.720
that to some extent by increasing the amount
of derivative term, increase the amount of

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.100
damping that will reduce the amount of overshoot.
But there are other consequences besides.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.549
What I am going to do is to add another scope
to this diagram. And bring in the scope here

00:10:18.549 --> 00:10:26.050
and what it’s going to do is to show the
torque that’s generated by the motor and

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:33.031
let’s run this.
So, I have a new scope, let's open that up

00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:40.529
and what we see here is the torque that we're
asking the motor to generate. Now, we can

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:46.399
see that there is spikes in the torque between
about plus five to minus five newton meters

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:51.230
of torque for asking the motor to produce.
As we increase the proportional gain, the

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.920
maximum torque that we ask the motor to produce
will keep increasing.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.899
Any real motor has got a finite torque capability.
It can't produce an infinite amount of torque.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:05.670
Now, ultimately, this is where the strategy
of increasing the proportional gain will come

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.839
unstuck. So, increase the proportional gain
we’re asking the motor provide more torque

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:14.910
and eventually, we’re be asking it to produce
more torque than it actually can do.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.559
So, we’ve seen the effects of increasing
the proportional gain. We’ve seen the effect

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:25.399
of adding an integral term. So, third strategy,
that’s often use to eliminate this kind

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:29.259
of error and that’s to introduce what’s
called a feed forward term.

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:34.189
Here's our block diagram from earlier and
we are going to introduce a feed forward control

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:39.259
term. And the key part of feed forward control,
is that in many cases, we actually can compute

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:44.220
what the disturbance force will be. So, in
the case of gravity, if we know the joint

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.569
angles, we can compute what the gravity force
is on each of the joints.

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:53.179
So, we can come up with an estimate of what
the gravity disturbance is and this is got

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:57.290
to be really helpful to us. This is extra
knowledge about the disturbance in we should

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.999
be able to use it to cancel the disturbance
out. The way we do that is we add another

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:06.700
summing junction into our control law and
it's got a negative sign on it and so, this

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.429
has got a negative gain or it's a subtraction.
And then to make it to all work, to balance

00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:17.720
out, we have to add a gain in here. This is
a gain of one on KdKm.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.290
If you think about it, if we have our estimated
torque here, we divided by KD and KM here.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:30.220
We multiply by KD and KM here. So, the overall
gain is now one and then we add that to the

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.519
actual disturbance and because of the negative
sign here, the disturbance is cancelled out.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:41.209
This is the essence of feed forward control.
It is a really neat trick.

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:45.899
Another strategy that we can adopt is to increase
the integral gain at the moment is equal to

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:50.699
zero. So, I’m going to put the proportional
gain back to one and I’m going to increase

00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:56.589
the integral gain to a value of one. We are
going to simulate that and see what happens.

00:12:56.589 --> 00:13:01.121
What we see is that the over shoot on the
square wave response has been reduced. It's

00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:05.139
back to what it was previously when we had
the proportional gain equal to one.

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.589
And here we can see the effect of the integral
term coming into play. When the external disturbance

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:16.899
is applied at time five, the error in the
control system increases. That is then integrated

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:22.779
over time to produce a torque which increases
over time so as to push the error towards

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:28.509
zero. We can see here the effect of the integrated
term ramping up. It’s pushing the error

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:32.769
down. From what we can see is an after short
amount of time, the upward of the integrated

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:38.639
has become equal to the value of the external
disturbance. And it has effectively cancelled

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.929
it out.
So, we can see towards the end of the trace

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:46.179
that the square wave response is pretty much
what we want it to be. The external disturbance

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:50.689
has been rejected. Let’s summarize.
We've looked at a number of different techniques

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:56.260
to reduce the effect of disturbance on the
position of a robot joint. We started off

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.369
looking at a very standard proportional derivative
typically known as a PD controller which got

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:06.699
a control law like this, a proportional gain
multiplied by the position error plus a derivative

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:12.239
gain multiplied by the velocity which helps
to control over shoot when the joint is moving.

00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:17.509
We saw that the amount of error is inversely
proportional to the gain P. Now, we can increase

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:22.579
P to reduce the error, but that has a number
of adverse consequences such as increasing

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:27.549
over shoot or providing signals to the motor
that it cannot possibly achieve.

00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:31.699
We then looked at an adding an integral term.
The intuition is that, with the constant error,

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:36.249
the integral over time is a signal that ramps
up which increases the torque so as to oppose

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:39.519
the torque that’s causing the disturbance
in the first place.

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:43.949
The third approach, we looked at, is feed forward
control which attempts to predict or estimate

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:48.129
the disturbance and then cancel it out. A
great advantage of feed forward control is

00:14:48.129 --> 00:14:53.579
even if you have a not perfect estimate of
what the disturbance is, some cancellation

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:58.689
is certainly better than no cancellation at
all. In practice, we often use a mixture of

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:03.809
feedback and feed forward control. They each
have particular strengths and advantages.
