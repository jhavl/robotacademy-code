00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.700
At the beginning of this lecture, we consider
the problem of why if I hold a sheet of paper

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.769
up in front of the scene, I do not see an
image on that sheet of paper. And the reason

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.300
for that as we talked about was that at any
particular point on the paper, we record the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.220
total amount of light that's falling on that
particular point and that light has come from

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.990
very, very many points in the real world itself.
We've recorded the total amount of light there.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.739
We didn't say anything about the direction
that the light rays came from.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.219
So, what if we could actually record at each
point not just the amount of light but the

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.480
direction that the light came from? This gets
us into the area of what's called a light

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.890
field. Now, a light field is, mathematically,
it's a function that describes the light that's

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.120
travelling in every single direction at every
single point in space.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.930
Think about the room that you're in at the
moment. Consider any particular point in that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.730
room and there'll be a large number of light
rays passing through that point and they will

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.019
have come from many many other points within
the room.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.680
So, very, very complex lots of light rays,
all going different directions and coming

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.159
from different places.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.729
So, a light field sensor attempts to capture
some of that, to capture the color, the intensity

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.000
and the vector direction of all these rays
of light. Traditional camera simply adds up

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.479
all the rays of light and records the sum
total. Light field cameras try to record the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.619
directions as well and the direction is really
important. Consider this example again of

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.259
the thin lens model. We have an object in
the world. It's a whole bunch of light rays

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.579
leaving the object passing through the lens
and passing through the focal plane.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.520
I've shown here a pixel and the light rays
that are entering that pixel are coming from

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.479
a large number of different directions. Letâ€™s
animate this, you can see that the object

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.740
is moving and we can see the light rays from the tip of that object moving across the array of pixels.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.540
 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.479
So, the object when it's really close to the
lens would be well out of focus in the traditional

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.540
camera. What's happening though is that those
light rays are now following across a range

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.150
of pixels and that each pixel, those light
rays are entering at a different angle.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.670
So, if those pixels were able to record not
just the amount of light but the direction

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.060
at which they are coming from as well, it
would be possible to compute the image even

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.410
though it is very, very out of focus and this
is a technology that's starting to emerge

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.500
now in what's called light field cameras.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.580
Now, one of the first on the market, the consumer
level of light field cameras, this one produced

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.620
by Light Row and in the right hand side of
this slide, what we can see is the light field

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.370
image being post-processed to bring a particular part of the image into focus. So, the person

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.069
is clicking on a particular point in the image
and using all the raw information from the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.190
light field, the amount of light and its direction,
we can compute the appropriate in focus image.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.750
We cant let every point in the image in focus
at all the time but we can now select after

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.260
we took the picture which part we would like
to have in focus and that's a big step forward.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.590
Early versions of light field cameras, the
research versions of these were very very

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.420
massive arrays of cameras, very expensive
and far from portable. Here's an example of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.409
an early portable light field camera. Again,
an array of cameras, which are trying to capture

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.409
the light rays coming from the world and the
various directions at which they've come from.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.709
This is a technology now, which is becoming
quite accessible as the cost of phones is

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.640
being reduced. It's now possible to create
enormous arrays of cameras and these videos

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.420
show some work that's being done using commodity
mobile phone cameras, cheap digital cameras

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.409
in order to be able to capture light fields
and once you have a captured light field then,

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.099
you can perform some very amazing visual effects,
stop motion effects and so on.
