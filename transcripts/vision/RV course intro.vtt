00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.300
Welcome, this is introduction to Robot Vision.
In this course we're going to talk about how

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.460
we give robots the sense of sight. Clearly
vision is a really important sense for us

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.550
in almost everything we do in our daily life.
And it plays a critically important role in

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.239
the life of almost all life forms on the planet.
So what I hope to do during this course is

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.450
convince you that vision is a really important
sense for robotics and we're going to talk

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.230
about how you actually get robots to understand
visual information. So this gets us into a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.120
field that's called "Computer Vision" so we
can consider this course as the first few

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.870
steps into this big field of computer vision.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.090
Computer vision is all about how you can use
cameras connected to computers to understand

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.659
the state of the world. It's a big field,
growing very, very quickly and it's massive

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.250
progress. But in this course, the first simple
steps into computer vision. So what we will

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.600
learn through the course is how we can take
images from a camera and use them to understand,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.299
to find, to recognize objects of different
size or shape or colour. So very simple information,

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.240
but this is enough information that can be
given to a robot to enable it to carry out

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.990
some simple tasks. So we're going to take
an image with millions of pixels of information

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.110
in it and turn that into information that
a robot can act on.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.170
I've spent almost my entire career working
on equipping robots with vision, the field

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.189
of robotic vision, so I hope in this course,
that I can convince you that vision is a really

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.689
important way for robots to sense the world
around them and that you will enjoy learning

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.270
some fundamentals of how it is we go about
making robots see.
