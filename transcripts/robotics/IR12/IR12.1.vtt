00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.540
Often when I give a public talk, somebody
in the audience asks me about artificial intelligence

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.040
and it's not a subject I feel particularly
comfortable to talk about. I consider myself

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.430
a roboticist, that is, somebody that builds
machines, whereas artificial intelligence

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.769
to me is a completely separate discipline,
a sub-discipline within computer science.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.509
Intelligence, of course, is also a very difficult
concept to understand and I think it also

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.320
has something to do with the historical context.
Way back in lecture number one, we looked

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.660
at this picture of the famous digesting duck.
And at that time, people considered that this

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.010
machine had life-like properties. Whether
it was intelligent or not, I'm not sure, but

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.340
people considered it to be very life-like.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.460
Later on came these automata, incredibly intricate
machines that could do seemingly intelligent

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.190
things. And perhaps at that time, people would
look at these machines and consider them to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.140
be intelligent because they did the sorts
of things that intelligent beings or entities,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.080
such as humans, are able to do quite readily.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.220
In the late 40's and early 50's, William Grey
Walter built a number of cybernetic devices,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.940
most famously his cybernetic tortoise. And
this was a machine that contained relays and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.820
vacuum tube technology.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.120
It was able to exhibit light-seeking behavior.
So if you put a light on the floor, this tortoise

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.830
would move towards the light and stop when
it got there. So again, this was a seemingly

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.549
intelligent behavior. This light-seeking behavior
is seen in many very simple organisms.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.810
So at the time, late 40's, early 50's, something
like this was perceived as being intelligent.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.049
Looking at it from our current viewpoint,
it looks rather primitive and sad but at that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.960
time, I think it was a significant breakthrough.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.939
The term artificial intelligence was probably
first introduced in this research proposal

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.409
from 1955 by a bunch of very imminent people,
amongst them John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky,

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.430
who are very very well known names in the
artificial intelligence community.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.870
By 1955, digital computers had become a reality
and this group of scientists were interested

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.599
in trying to explore what could they do beyond
straightforward numerical calculation. So

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.069
they were interested in things like neural
networks, theories of computation, could we

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.660
use computers to do natural language processing,
could they perform acts of creativity?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.380
What you'll notice from looking at the list
of topics that they proposed to investigate

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.190
in their summer project was there's no mention
of robotics and there is no mention of computer

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.520
vision. The reason for that is that those
two things had not yet been invented.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.020
The first industrial robot as we know it today was developed by Unimation Inc.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.380
and that company wasn't even formed until 1956,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.280
one year after the artificial intelligence project and Unimation delivered its first robot in 1961.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280
But thereafter, a number other robots appeared in quite rapid succession.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.160
They were all developed within artificial
intelligence laboratories at Stanford and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.239
at MIT and chief amongst these robot designers
was Victor Scheinman who designed the ORM

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.819
and ORM I believe, is Norwegian for snake and he also designed the very famous Stanford arm in 1968.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.160
Computer vision really got its start in 1964
with the PhD work of Larry Roberts at MIT.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.610
He was interested in understanding how computers
could interpret a blocks world. So a camera

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.660
attached to a computer would take a gray-scale
image of a scene and with various sorts of

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.110
early image processing algorithms, could find
the edges and then fit a model to that. Larry

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.450
Roberts went on to do really great things
in the creation of the Internet.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.550
So then, what is intelligence? I can look
in the dictionary and get a definition of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.180
intelligence, but to me, this is not particularly
helpful. I think we assume that human beings

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.920
are intelligent so therefore, the behaviors
manifest by human beings count as intelligence.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.129
But we know that there are many animals that
can exhibit intelligent behavior and it's

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.859
been found in more and more simple animals.
Once upon a time, we believed it was perhaps

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.199
only the great apes that could exhibit some
sort of intelligence but now scientists have

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.070
found quite intelligent behaviors in all manner
of species. Even birds are able to fashion

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.240
simple tools to help them to achieve particular
tasks.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.040
A definition I particularly like comes from
Rodney Brooks and that is that intelligence

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.580
is in the eye of the beholder. So if you're
looking at a machine doing some task and you

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.620
think it's intelligent, then it is intelligent.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.130
Perhaps the best known definition of intelligence
is the Turing test and it was proposed by

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.410
the English mathematician, Alan Turing, in
a 1950 paper called Computing Machinery and

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.449
Intelligence. In that particular paper, he
proposed something called the imitation game,

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.180
and of course that's the name of the recent
movie about the life of Alan Turing.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.310
The game has three players: A is a computer
which is being tested for intelligence, B

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.990
is a real human being, and C is the judge.
The judge doesn't know which of A or B is

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.550
the computer and so asks questions of A and
B to try and determine which is which.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.340
In order to mask the really obvious cues about
which one of A or B is the computer, the game

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.000
is generally played with keyboard and screen
communication, so there's no verbal communications.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.060
The judge types commands on a keyboard, A
or B respond with information displayed on a screen.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.820
Now if the judge, after asking sufficient
questions, is unable to determine which of

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.490
A or B is the computer, then the computer
is deemed to be intelligent because the judge,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.490
who is intelligent, is unable to tell the
difference between it and a real human being.
