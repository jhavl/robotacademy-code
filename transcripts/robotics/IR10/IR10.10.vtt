00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.770
Modern electric motors are wonderful devices,
but there are limits to their performance.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.759
There is a maximum acceleration, a maximum
velocity and a maximum power.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.380
So, let’s look first at what limits the
acceleration of a motor. We have rearranged

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.410
an earlier equation in to this form here,
the ratio of the motor torque to the motor

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.290
inertia. Clearly because inertia is in the
denominator, if we increase inertia, we are

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.050
going to reduce the acceleration. The inertia
that the motor experiences has got two components.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.160
One of those components is the inertia of
the motor’s armature. That’s the rotating

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.890
part of electric motor that I denote by J
sub m. The other inertia that the motor experiences

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360
is due to the link itself.
In this case, I have drawn a very simple rectangular

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.230
prism for the link and the inertia of that
is M times R squared. The R squared is problematic

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.320
because it means that the inertia grows very
quickly with the size of the link.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.440
So, we can write the total inertia that the
motor experiences in terms of these two components,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000
the motor armature inertia which is a constant
and the inertia of the link. And, in this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.180
simple case, the inertia of the link is a
constant. But, for a real robot, the inertia

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.110
is going to depend on the configuration of
all the links that are attached to the end

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.470
of this particular link and also to the payload
which is held by the last link in the chain.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.360
So, the link inertia is going to be highly
variable. However, in a real robot, there's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.950
typically a gearbox between the motor and
the link and this is another advantage of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.759
the gearbox because it allows me to write
the expression for inertia like this.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.829
The inertia of the link is reduced by a factor
of G squared. And, for a robot like the Puma,

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.859
G is a number anywhere between say 10 and
a 100. So, the link inertia is going to be

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.880
greatly reduced. It means that the inertia
that the motor control system is going to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.109
“see” is dominated by the constant motor armature
inertia.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.181
Variation in inertia due to link configuration
change is going to be very, very small. If

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:09.229
we consider now the numerator of the expression
at the top, we know that the maximum torque

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.120
depends on the maximum current. The maximum
possible current is a function of the power

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.720
amplifier which supplies current to the motor.
If we apply too much current to the motor,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.709
the armature and the brushes will overheat
and be damaged.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.390
Also, remember that some of the torque generated
by the motor is used to oppose friction and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.920
also to oppose gravity in the motor. So, less
of it is actually available for acceleration.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.290
What we have defined here is an upper bound
on the maximum acceleration of the robot joint.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.849
Turning now to the maximum velocity
the electrical model for the motor contains

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.849
a generator, the circle is the back EMF source, and
as the motor rotates faster and faster, the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.269
back EMF rises. And, when the back EMF equals
the applied voltage, then no further current

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.430
can flow in to motor. It will stop accelerating
and that will define the maximum speed of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.549
the motor given by an equation like this.
The electrical power in to the motor is given

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.659
by the product of the applied voltage and
current. The mechanical power out of the motor

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.049
is the product of speed and the torque. We
can plot motor torque against motor speed

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.390
and there are other two critical points on
this curve.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.519
One point is when the motor has got no load
at all and it’s spinning as fast as it possibly

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.220
can. We refer to this as the no load speed.
At the other end of the line, the motor is

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.840
stalled. It’s not actually rotating but
it is exerting a torque and we refer to this

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.049
as the stall torque.
Power is a quadratic function of speed has

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.920
a maximum somewhere in the middle of the operating
speed range of the motor and the motor cannot

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.409
be operated for a sustained period of time
above its maximum power rating or else it

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.119
will be damaged through overheating.
