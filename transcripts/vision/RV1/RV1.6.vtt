00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.370
The sense of vision has long fascinated human
kind.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.230
In the time of the Greeks, they believed that
vision was somewhat analogous to the sense

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.890
of touch. And what happened is when you open
your eyes and you looked at an object there

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.140
was some visual fire, some visual flux left
your eye, went out and touched the object

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.769
and the sense of vision was in fact the interaction
between this emanating flux and the object

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.600
itself. It was like a long distance sense
of touch.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.059
Over time the modern interpretation of the
way vision works was developed, and certainly

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.859
by the Middle Ages I think, it was quite well
understood. And the way we understand today

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.840
is that a scene is illuminated by a light
source, in this case the sun. Rays of light

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.420
fall down onto objects and is reflected into
all sorts of different directions, and some

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.309
of those light rays are reflected into our
eye, where they are focused onto photoreceptors

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.489
and lead to some stimulation to the brain,
which we interpret as visual perception.
