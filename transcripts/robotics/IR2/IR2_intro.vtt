00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.670
In this lecture, we want to talk about how
we describe the position of things in the

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.620
world. In robotics, this is really, really
important.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.110
For instance, in our robotics problem, we
might want to describe the position of a robot.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.650
We might also want to describe the position
of something that the robot wants to interact

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.210
with. For instance, it might want to interact
with my water bottle. So I need to describe

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.950
the position of the robot, the position of
the water bottle and I’m also interested

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.260
in describing the relative position.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.860
Where is the water bottle with respect to
the robot? And that's clearly something that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.330
the robot would like to know if it wanted
to go and pick up the water bottle.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.860
When it comes to describing the position of
things, we need some kind of frame of reference.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.350
This is a pretty important aspect of describing
the position of things in the world. Here

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.040
is a picture of our world. And one of the
things we need to keep in mind of course is

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.930
that our world, the surface of our world is
moving. A point on the surface at the earth

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.860
– the equator is moving nearly 500 meters
per second in space. The earth itself is moving

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.180
at quite a high speed around the sun. And
then our solar system is moving at very high

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.020
speed around the centre of the galaxy. And
the galaxy itself is moving at incredible

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.610
speed towards the constellation Leo. So, everything
is in motion.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.610
If we're trying to describe where things are,
it's really important that we consider the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.470
frame of reference.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.310
Everything is moving so we just have to put
effectively a stake in the ground and say,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.150
"This is the reference point and we'll decide
all positions with respect to that reference

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.880
point". That's exactly what we do. We're going
to put a stake in the ground. For instance,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.700
like this sign post here and say, "This is
the origin. This is the coordinate, zero zero

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.800
and we're going to measure all distances from
that.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.909
And we're going to create a coordinate frame.
Effectively two orthogonal axes. An x-axis,

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.530
and a y-axis, sorts of things that you learn
at school. And we're going to use those two

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.319
distances, the distance along the x-axis, the
distance along the y-axis, in order to describe

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.990
the position of an object in two-dimensional
space.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.760
In this lecture, we're going to keep things
simple. We're only going to consider the position

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.790
in two dimensions. In the next lecture, I
will kick it up a notch and talk about position

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.870
in 3 dimensions.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.360
Now, reference points are entirely arbitrary.
So, let's talk for a moment about the reference

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.960
system that we use on our own planet. So,
here we have a depiction of planet earth.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.100
And this is a projection, the earth of course
is a sphere. And to make a rectangular map

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.450
like this what we have to do is cut the sphere,
unroll it, stretch it out so that it looks

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.930
like a rectangle. And we put a couple of reference
lines on our globe. The most important one,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.480
perhaps the most obvious one, is the equator.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.260
Because the earth is a sphere, we have an
obvious axis which is that which the planet

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.890
rotates around. And you may create a plane
orthogonal to this rotational axis that cuts

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.910
the sphere into two equal hemispheres, and
we call that line the equator and it shown

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.900
here in black. And you can go and visit the
equator when you can stand with your leg one

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.270
in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.849
Now there's another line, which we call the
Prime meridian and it passes orthogonal to

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.160
the equator, and it passes through the Greenwich
observatory in London.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.770
This line is completely arbitrary. It doesn't
have to be through the Greenwich observatory

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.099
but the convention on our planet is that
we used the Greenwich observatory line as

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.030
the Prime meridian, and you can go visit Greenwich
you can put your feet on either side

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.250
of the Prime meridian in the West and the
Eastern Hemispheres of the planet.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.850
The distance in the horizontal direction,
we refer to as longitude. And the direction,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.610
the distance in the other direction, we refer
to as latitude. So we have lines of longitude

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.790
and lines of latitude that we inscribe onto
the sphere. And those two numbers, longitude

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.640
and latitude, are sufficient to describe the
position of any point, any place on the surface

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.570
of our planet.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.720
Now, we have this arbitrary line as I've mentioned
before which we called the Prime meridian

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.099
which goes through the Greenwich observatory.
If history had been different, we would have

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:31.509
had a different Prime meridian. There was
a proposal for the Prime meridian to go through

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.409
the Paris observatory. And if you visit Paris
today, you can see a line referred to as the

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:43.410
Arago line which is where this non-existent
Prime meridian passes through the city of

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.050
Paris. And it's named after a French astronomer
and mathematician, Arago, who proposed that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.409
particular Prime meridian.

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.310
So, the take home message here is that this
Prime meridian is completely arbitrary. It

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.629
is a convention that we've all agreed upon.
It's useful to have this convention and that's

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.679
how we describe points on the planet of the
earth.
