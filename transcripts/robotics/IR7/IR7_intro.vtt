00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.290
In the last lecture, we talked about robot
forward kinematics, and forward kinematics

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.380
is the relationship between the robot joint
angles, which we represent by a vector I call

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.770
'Q, and the pose of the robot end effector.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.730
We can describe this in terms of a mathematical
function. We can describe forward kinematics

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.119
as the function curly K of the robot joint
angles, and the return value of that function

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.270
is the pose of the end effector. This is very
very useful in robotics, but more useful is

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.940
what's called the 'Inverse Kinematics.'

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.980
This is the function that tells us that joint
angles that we need in order to achieve a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.870
particular robot end effector pose.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.769
So say we want the robots end effector to
be at this particular pose in space, then

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.300
what should the joint angles be set to in order for the robot end effector to get to that particular pose?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.600
This is called the 'Inverse Kinematics Problem' that's really key to arm type robots.
