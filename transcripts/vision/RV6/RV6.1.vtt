00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.970
How many colors are there?
It sounds like a very simple question but

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.699
the answer is far from simple. It’s commonly
agreed that there are seven colors in a rainbow.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.960
They are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo and violet. If you ask the Crayola

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.740
Company, the people who make crayons, they’ve
got 120 different colored crayons in their

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.289
range. The HTML language, which describes
web pages, has got 121 uniquely named colors

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.910
that we can use. Many Unix-based operating
systems, for instance, the very popular Linux

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.220
operating system, have a windowing system
called X11, and X11 distributions come with

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.790
a file called RGB.text, which lists a whole
bunch of different colors, and the last time

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.750
I looked at this file it contained 881 different
colors.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.660
If you look at a collection of all the words
in the English language, what they call the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.680
English Corpus, there are around 4000 different
words that we use to describe colors.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.350
Another simple question that’s got a complex
answer is ‘where does one color end and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.859
another color start?’. So over here we can
see a figure which contains a range of colors

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:19.159
from reds, yellows, greens, blues, and so
on. And in a recent exercise they surveyed

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.200
a large number of web users, 1.5 million web
users, and asked them to draw boundaries between

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.679
the different colors, and to name them. And
this is a consensus across 1.5 million web

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.599
users. It shows what people tend to agree
as being green and what they think is blue

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.639
and what they think is teal and so on. This
is difficult because we’re trying to delineate

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:46.310
regions in color, and color is a continuum,
and we’re trying to enforce sort of arbitrary

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.759
boundaries across this otherwise continuous
notion of color.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.369
The way we interpret color also depends on
our cultural background. In Asia, orange is

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.569
a very, very positive color, but in the United
States, Australia and parts of Europe, orange

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.759
is considered to be a color of danger or of
hazard. Some African languages, for example,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.390
do not have any words which distinguish the
color red from the color orange. However,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.620
all of the languages have got words to describe
black and white, and if the language has got

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.130
more colors than just those two, the next
most likely color that they are going to describe

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.340
is red, and next most likely is either yellow
or green. Blue is frequently the sixth named

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.190
color in many languages, so blue really is
not as important as red and green, black and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.980
white. Brown comes later and then all of the
other colors that we’ve got names for.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.720
This rather complex graph shows a relationship
between the culture, which is indicated by

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.880
the letters here, and the emotion, which is
indicated by the radial color bars, numbered

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.440
from 1 through 284. What we can see is the
very different colors that are used to represent

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.480
different emotions or feelings across cultures.
If we look at the occurrence of color terms

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.970
in a big collection of English words, for
instance, the Bank of English Corpus contains

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.940
a lot of literature from the United States,
United Kingdom, and Australia for example,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.680
then we could look at a histogram of the occurrence
of those color words. And we see that black

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.370
is by far the most frequently occurring word,
followed by white, followed by red, green

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.390
blue and so on, whereas the least occurring
words are those like ultramarine and chartreuse.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.490
The most common color words are also the oldest.
So 1200 years ago there weren’t that many

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.680
different color words but as time has passed
we’ve introduced more and more color words

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.990
into our vocabulary. There’s a big transition
point around the year 800, where we changed

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.350
form a focus just on brightness, talking about
white, black, grey and so on, where we started

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.950
to get more interested in talking about the
hue, the actual color, rather than just the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.980
brightness. Perhaps this was a technological
transition as well, perhaps when dyes and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.069
pigments became much more common.
The Pantone company’s whole livelihood is

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:24.139
based on color. They catalogue colors, they
describe all of the colors using unique numeric

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.969
codes, and they promote every year a color
of the year. So the color of the year in 2013

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.229
is this green. The bottom line is that color is really, really important to humans.
