00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.760
Peter: Robotic aircraft are becoming ubiquitous.
There's a whole class now of quite sophisticated

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.870
toys you can go and buy from the shop for
a few hundred bucks. Generally, there are

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.000
quad rotor machines. You can control them
with your iPhone. You can fly them up. You

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.180
can look out the neighbor's fence. You can
look in neighbor's window. So, this technology

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.050
is starting to cause people serious concerns
with respect to privacy. So Doug, what does

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.270
ethics say about privacy?

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.100
Doug: The construct of privacy is a modern
construct.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.360
Peter: Okay. We didn't use to have privacy?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.300
Doug: Well, it's culturally defined.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:55.340
Doug: In other words, what I consider private
today in 21st century Australia and what you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.589
would consider private in 1850 London, it's
quite different. What we choose in terms of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.979
privacy is different. It's contextual over
time and place. However--

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.710
Peter: So, it's not a fundamental underlying
principle?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.310
Doug: No.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.909
Peter: Okay.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.299
Doug: No, absolutely not. Privacy is not.
It's founded in liberal democracy and the

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:27.770
right of the individual to choose and have
their own space. The Americans are the only,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.679
I think they're the only culture that has
right to property. With the right to property

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.639
comes right to privacy. But the degree of
privacy, of course, is being argued right

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.759
now in Australia in terms of access to data.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.700
Peter: Absolutely.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.039
Doug: Yes. So, in terms of ethics, it goes
back again to those fundamental duties or

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.270
those fundamental concepts of autonomy. So,
we have levels of freedom in terms of autonomy.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.229
So, those levels go from freedom, of course,
of restraint down to the freedom of choice,

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.179
then to informed reason, informed choice and
lastly, the choice based on the recognition

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.220
of moral values. So, those are areas in terms
of autonomy that are critical in ethics. Now,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.750
if you lose your privacy, in terms of ethics,
the only ethical argument here is how it affects

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.650
your individual autonomy to make decisions.
But privacy is certainly not an ethical issue,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.780
it's a cultural issue.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.420
Peter: So, if it's cramping your style or it's changing what you can do, then it's an ethical issue.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.120
Doug: It is.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.799
Doug: Because it's affecting your power of
choice. Again, that's a modern construct is

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.150
privacy. It's a modern construct. It's quite
different. For example, in Roman times you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.150
may take a shower - or you don't take a shower
you take baths - with other people, today

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.360
we have our own bathrooms. But privacy…
when I grew up with five kids and two bedrooms…

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.000
it's a different construct now, right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.349
Peter: Yes.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.969
Doug: It's culturally determined.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.409
Peter: There are some people who say that
privacy is a concept that is just going to

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.409
go away and we should just get used to it.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.099
Doug: Yes.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.489
Peter: Particularly, with respect to our online
existence and identities.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.509
Doug: Yes, yes. Autonomy is the issue, not
privacy.
