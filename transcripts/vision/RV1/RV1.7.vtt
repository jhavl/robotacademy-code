00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.370
Let’s discuss the human vision system. Now
I am not a biologist, so I am going to give

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.730
you an engineer’s impression of how the
human vision system works.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.600
Firstly we have the eye itself, and looking
at an eye perhaps the most obvious feature

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.930
is the white part, which is called the sclera,
and the iris. Now the sclera is fibrous tissue,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.050
which is an important part of the structure
of the eye and some kinds of animals the sclera

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.800
actually has bony components in it and in
this fossil here you can see a ring of bone,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.860
which is actually part of the sclera of that
animal’s eye.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.660
If we look at the cross section of the eye
on the right here, we can see that the sclera

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.820
which is part of the membrane that surrounds
the eyeball itself. We can see the iris and

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.770
the pupil which regulates the light going
into the eye. We can see the lens, which is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.390
a transparent, crystalline protein structure
which focuses the light onto the retina on

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.290
the back of the eye.
The inside of the eye is filled with a fairly

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.729
transparent fluid, and at the back of the
eye we have a surface which is called the

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.150
retina, a curved surface which contains the
photoreceptors, that is, the light sensitive

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.090
part of the eye. And that is then connected
by this big nerve bundle—the optic nerve—to the brain.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.909
In fact, we can actually think
of the eye as being a part of the brain. It

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.729
is connected by a significant nerve bundle,
and then the eye is essentially a sensory

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.479
part of the brain located in the front of
our heads.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.220
Let’s now look in more detail at the retina
of the eye. So if we take a transect, we move

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.950
from inside the eye to outside of the eye
along the direction of that arrow we pass

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.670
through a number of layers of cells and blood
vessels and whatever. Now this is all on a

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.189
pretty small scale; this total structure is
about 500 microns thick.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.950
The light sensitive cells are at the bottom
of this structure. So they are not on the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.279
surface of the retina, they are actually about
500 microns below the surface of the retina.

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:22.829
So the light has to pass through—diffuse
through—these cells and blood vessels before

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.790
it gets to the light sensitive cells.
Now you’ve probably heard people talking

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.139
about rods and cones. The rods cells and the
cone cells are the light sensitive elements.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:39.749
They are the photoreceptors in our eye. The
rod cells are these spaghetti shaped structures.

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:45.599
They are kind of thin. And they are sensitive
to low light levels. So we use the rod cells

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:53.169
when we are working in a very low light environment.
The cone cells are these strange, stumpy shaped

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.279
cells; they are a little bit conical, kind
of squat, not as tall as the rods. And these

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.669
cells are sensitive to colour. And there are
three different types of cones cells: there

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.219
are some that are sensitive to red light,
some sensitive to green light and some sensitive

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:13.679
to blue light. But the characteristic they
all share is that they are this somewhat conical shape.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.260
Another way we can consider the eye is to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.930
look at where the optic fibre joins the retina
and that creates an area on the retina which

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.729
is called the optic disk where there are actually
no light sensitive cells. So there is a part

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.919
of the retina that does not respond to light.
And there is another part of the retina where

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:40.959
we have an enormous concentration of light
sensitive cells and that area is called the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.040
fovea. The fovea and the optic nerve are separated
by some distance.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.870
So in this graph here what we are going to
see is the density of photoreceptor cells,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.669
and there is a huge peak in the number of
cone cells per square millimetre in this area

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:05.069
we call the fovea. So we have exquisite resolution
in this one small area of our eye. The rest

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.739
of the eye, we have much less resolution and
unconsciously our eye is continually moving,

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.900
focusing, on different parts of the scene,
directing the fovea to these different parts.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.310
So we build up a high resolution of the image
by directing the high resolution fovea all

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.520
over the scene we are looking at.
Now with the rod cells they have a quite different

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.330
spatial density pattern. There are very few
rod cells in the fovea area, but there’s

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.530
many more rod cells in what we call our peripheral
vision; away from the direction that our eye

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.310
is pointing. This is very useful at night
and these cells are also somewhat motion sensitive.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.169
They are what give us the ability to see something
moving out of the corner of our eye.

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.710
So what is really interesting then is this
business of the optic nerve entering the retina

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.050
and creating what we call the blind spot.
Now we can actually detect our blind spot

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.000
using a pattern, something like this. So what
you do is close your right eye and stare at

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.520
the plus sign. And then move your head toward
and away from the screen making absolutely

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.270
sure that you are looking with your left eye
at the plus sign. As you move your head in

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.449
and out, the circle here will at some point
fall onto the optic disk on your retina and

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.580
it will, quite surprisingly, it will just
disappear from view. So you can have some

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.919
fun with a test like this, you can find others
online. Have a play and see if you can find

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.949
your blind spot. It is quite surprising that
in everyday life we don’t notice that we

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.129
have got a blind spot. We go to a bit of trouble,
we can actually detect that it is there.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.740
Now if we look at, for instance, our horizontal
cross section of the brain. We can see the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.949
eyes located at the front of the head and
the optic nerve bundles carry the visual information

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.090
through the brain to the back part of the
brain, where we have our visual cortex. And

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.719
that is where we have all the really exciting
visual processing going on. That is where

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:15.400
part of our brain is responsible for recognising
people and objects and motion and so on. But

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.139
the human brain is a very complex structure.
It weighs something like 1.5 kilograms and

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:28.400
is about 1011 neurons in there. So an awful
lot of computation and memory capability.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.199
Nearly a third of that is devoted to processing
visual information.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.590
Earlier we used the argument that the eye
has been invented so many times by evolution

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.409
that it must be a very effective sensor for
animals. But there is a cost for the sense

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:51.919
of vision, and in the case of human beings
one of those costs is that a third of our

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:57.340
brain is devoted to processing this visual
information. So yes, it is a very effective

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.920
sensor that as an organism we pay quite a
cost in order to run that sensor.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.900
Additional costs are associated with the eyes themselves.

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:13.520
They are very delicate structures, so we evolved mechanisms to protect the eye.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.200
For instance,
our eyelids and eyelashes, mechanisms to clean the eyes with tear ducts and so on,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.340
and the eyes are also moved within the head by some very high performance muscles.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.360
So there is a lot of auxiliary machinery involved in maintaining the sense of vision.
