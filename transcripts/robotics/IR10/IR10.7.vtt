00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.799
The simplest and most common model of friction
is called linear friction, sometimes also

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.350
called viscous friction or viscous damping.
Then, the force or the torque is proportional

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.750
to velocity. So, there are two cases. We can
consider a linear case where we have friction

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.060
force proportional to velocity, v, or we
can have the rotational case where a frictional

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.070
torque, tau, is proportional to the rotational
speed, omega. If we plot force against velocity,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.430
we can represent the characteristic of friction
by a straight line of slope B and refer to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.090
B as the friction coefficient.
Typically, the slope of the line for positive

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.850
and negative velocities is the same. Here
is the model for a current controlled electric

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.879
motor that we introduced earlier. It relates
the rotation acceleration to the applied current.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.769
And, I’m going to add a frictional torque
term here. And, friction is a real issue in

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.609
most electric motors. The friction is due
to the bearings that the shaft rotates within.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.320
And, for motors with brushes this represents the
frictional force of the brushes rubbing on

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.100
the motor’s Commutator.
I can rearrange the equation to look like

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.450
this and then I can transform it and put it
into transfer function form. So, here we

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.240
have the transfer function for an electric
motor and it incorporates the motor torque

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.479
constant, the inertia of the motor and the
friction of the motor. Some systems exhibit

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.840
a nonlinear friction and the most classic
case of this is known as Coulomb friction

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.990
and this is named after a famous French physicist
who also did a lot of work in electrostatics

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.140
and the unit of electric charge is named after
this same gentleman.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.860
Like the linear friction we looked at before,
the nonlinear friction force always opposes

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.299
the direction of motion.
Interestingly, Coulomb friction is not defined

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.080
for the case of zero velocity. We define the
amount of friction when the mechanism is moving

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.600
in the positive direction and when the mechanism
is moving in the negative direction, and these

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.850
values may be the same or they may be different.
It depends on the mechanism.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.450
For a real machine, friction is actually a
combination of both these two effects, the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.150
nonlinear Coulomb friction and the linear
friction. Once again, this friction curve

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.599
is not defined for the case of zero velocity.
These two terms may be the same or different

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.080
and the slope of the line for positive and
negative velocities may be the same or it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.870
may be different. Once again, it depends on
the particular machine.
