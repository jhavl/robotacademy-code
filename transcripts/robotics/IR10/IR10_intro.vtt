00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.470
In this lecture, we're going to talk about
Robot Joint Control. That's how do we actually

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.920
make a robot move. It's a really important
problem. So, using some of the principles

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.529
that we've already learned about in this course,
we have a robot here and we're going to say,

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.770
"I want the robot end-effector to be at this
particular pose." This is a constraint that

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.300
comes from the particular task that I'm trying
to do. I'm a robot arm and I want to pick

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.690
up this particular object then I know the
pose that the robot end-effector has to achieve.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.640
Now, I can use the inverse kinematics
to tell me what should be the angles in the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.960
joints of the robot arm in order for the end
of the arm to get to that particular pose.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
So, we’ve talked about how to do this. This
is the inverse kinematic problem. The challenge

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.460
that we’re going to talk about in this lecture
is how do I actually make the joint adopt

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.050
a particular angle. The joint’s got a motor
in it. It’s got some sensors in it. So we’re

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.080
going to talk about the control system that
makes the joint have the particular angle

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.450
that we want it to have. This is the joint
control problem.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.659
Now, this business of trying to control the
position of a motor to control the angle of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.920
a robot joint is a really common problem in
mechatronics. There are many, many motion

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.049
control systems in all sorts of things that
we own that we probably don’t even know

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.470
that they’re there. In an ink jet printer,
there is a very precise motion control system

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.950
that’s moving the printing print head across
the paper.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.490
Another motion control system is moving the
paper backwards and forwards through the printer.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.890
A robot vacuum cleaner has got a motion control
system to control the speed of each of its

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.810
wheels so that it moves with the appropriate
velocity across the floor.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.100
Within a hard disk drive in your computer
or within DVD drive, there is a head which

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.899
reads the information off the spinning disk.
It has to be positioned really precisely over

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.299
the disk’s surface.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.759
This motion control systems are very, very
pervasive pieces of technology in the modern

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.380
world. So, what we’re going to learn about
today is a very particular case of a motion

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.740
control system. It’s a motion control system
that’s controlling the angle of a robot’s joint.
