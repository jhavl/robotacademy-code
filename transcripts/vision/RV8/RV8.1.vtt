00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419
Homogeneous coordinates

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.940
We’ll start by recapping some fundamentals
of two-dimensional geometry. To start with,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.299
we’re going to talk about a Euclidian plane.
A Euclidian plane is a non-curved surface

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.840
where the rules of Euclidian geometry apply.
We normally take this for granted.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
We’re just going to be explicit about the
fact that we’re working with flat surfaces.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.699
The second concept is Cartesian coordinates.
Again, this is a concept you should be well

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.980
familiar with. We have a set of orthogonal
axes typically labeled X and Y. We have a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.780
point P and we describe its position with
respect to the origin in terms of distances

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.420
along the X and Y axes. A concept that is
perhaps less familiar to you will be homogenous

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.360
coordinates and we’re going to be using
them a lot in this lecture. Those of you who’ve

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.399
done the introduction to robotics course will
have already encountered homogenous coordinates.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.190
To represent a point in a two-dimensional
Cartesian space, we describe it by a pair

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.200
of numbers written as tuple X, Y and we say
that this point lives in the space of two-dimensional

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.740
real numbers, which we denote by the symbol
R2 (R squared).

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.070
In homogenous coordinates, we represent the
same point with three numbers. In this case,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.500
we’ve represent it as X, Y and the number
one. In fact, the number one is somewhat arbitrary;

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.200
it could be any non-zero constant. We say
now that this point belongs to the two-dimensional

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.799
projective space, which we denote by the symbol
P2 (P squared). So it’s the same point,

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.320
just two different ways to represent it. The
homogenous representation, the representation

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.820
in projective space is going to be very, very
handy to us in this lecture.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.140
Now to convert from homogenous coordinate
to a Cartesian coordinate, I’m going to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.439
start with the very general homogenous coordinate
denoted here as X tilde, Y tilde and Z tilde.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.990
To convert it through a Cartesian coordinate
what I do is take the first two numbers and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.989
divide by the third. So X and Y Cartesian
coordinates are given by X tilde on Z tilde

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.379
and Y tilde on Z tilde respectively.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.560
Now a mathematician would say that in projective
space, lines and points have duals. They have

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.720
equivalent representations. Some very interesting
and very useful things flow from this duality.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.480
We can write a line in homogenous form a little
bit different to what we’re used to but

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.989
we can write a line as three numbers denoted
here as L1, L2 and L3. Imagine that I’ve

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.540
got a point which moves along that line. So
the line is really the set of all possible

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.010
points that lie along it. I can express the
fact that the point lies on the line by the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.959
dot product of the line and the point being
equal to zero. We refer to this as the point

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.730
equation of a line. A line is defined in terms
of all the points that could possibly lie

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.560
along it.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.409
Now I can expand that out and we can see that
that looks a little bit different to the conventional

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.959
Cartesian representation of a line. But if
we do the transformation from homogenous coordinates

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.629
to Cartesian coordinates, we can show that
these two representations of a line are equivalent.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.810
An advantage of using the homogenous form
is that it’s very easy to represent a line

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.400
that is vertical where in Cartesian coordinates,
that means that the grading of the line is

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.129
equal to infinity. In homogenous form, we
treat that situation very simply and conveniently.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.080
We don’t need to introduce any infinities.
We also might be interested in how to describe

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.150
a line that joins two points. So here we have
two points and here’s a line that passes

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.530
through those two points. Then the homogenous
representation of the line which remember

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.420
is the three vector is given simply by the
cross-product of the two points that lie on

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.030
the line. So a very, very simple way of finding
the equation of a line that joins two points

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.040
much, much more conveniently than it is for
Cartesian coordinates.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.330
We might also be interested in the problem
of the coordinate of the point at the intersection

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.560
of two lines. So here we have two lines and
this is the intersection point and the intersection

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.199
point is given by the cross-product of the
two lines. We call this the line equation

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.990
of a point. The point is defined in terms
of two lines.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.340
So let’s create a point. A horizontal coordinate of
100. A vertical coordinate of 200. And points

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.940
are represented as Coulomb vectors. So that’s
a row vector that I’ve written just there,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.680
so I will transpose it. So that will display
as a Coulomb vector. So this is a Euclidean

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.520
or Cartesian coordinate for a point.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.240
Now we can convert the Euclidean coordinate
into a homogeneous coordinate using the function

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.979
e2h, and we can see that all it has done is
appended a 1 to it. So now instead of a vector

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.120
with two elements, its now a Coulomb vector
with three elements. The last element is a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.060
one.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.979
Now we can convert the homogeneous coordinate
back to a Euclidean coordinate by using the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.180
inverse function h2e, for homogeneous to Euclidean, and I apply that to the answer

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.780
for the last operation and we see that it
is back now to a vector with two elements.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.389
The result is the vector that we started with.
