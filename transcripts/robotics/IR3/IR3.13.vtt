00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.540
So, as we should well know by now, pose has
got 2 components; a translational component

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.910
and a rotational component. And there are
several ways that we can represent a pose.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.890
We could represent the translational component
as a vector, and then we could represent the

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.230
rotational component by a set of 3 Euler angles.
Alternatively, we could represent it by a

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.999
vector plus a set of 3 roll, pitch, yaw angles.
Or we could represent it as a vector plus

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.200
a quaternion. The fourth option is to represent
it as a homogeneous transformation and this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.590
is what we did for the 2-dimensional case.
As we've done several times already in this

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.250
lecture we've lifted concepts from 2-dimensions
in to 3-dimensions and that's what we're going

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.969
to do next. We are going to work out how we
describe pose as a homogeneous transformation

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.510
in 3-dimensions.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.269
Consider two 3-dimensional coordinate frames
and a point P. Now, I'm going to introduce

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.989
a frame {V}. It has the same origin as coordinate
frame B but its axes are parallel to coordinate

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.240
frame A. I can describe the point P with respect
to the coordinate frame {V} by using a rotation,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.770
rotation from coordinate frame {V} to coordinate
frame B. I can describe the origin of frame

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.940
{V} by a vector with respect to frame A and
I can describe the point P in terms of a vector

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.030
with respect to coordinate frame A. I can
write a simple vector relationship. I can

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.350
add these 2 vectors because coordinate frame
{V} has its axes parallel to those of coordinate frame A.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.240
Now, I can substitute the first relationship
and I have now an expression for a point with

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.940
respect to frame A in terms of a vector with
respect to the original coordinate frame B

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.020
and I can substitute A for {V} because the
axis of frames {V} and A are parallel to each other.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.630
I can substitute in the elements of the rotation
matrix and expand the vectors in terms of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.420
their elements and then, I can augment the
vector by appending a 1 to it and move the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.990
translation between the origins of the coordinate
frames into the matrix. And to keep things

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.310
tidy, I'm going to augment the other vector
as well which means I have to pack the matrix

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.250
out with some zeroes and ones. So, what we
have now is a homogeneous representation.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.500
We have a homogeneous transformation matrix
and two homogeneous vectors. We can write

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.470
it in compact form like this with the note
that the homogeneous vectors by putting a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.530
tilde above them. We can see that this matrix
comprises a rotation component, a translational

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.520
component, 3 zeroes and a one.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.970
So, this single 4 x 4 matrix encapsulates
rotation and translation and allows us to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.440
transform a vector describing a point from
coordinate frame B to coordinate frame A.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.510
This 4 x 4 matrix here, we refer to as a
homogeneous transformation and these 2 vectors

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.270
here are homogeneous vectors. And just a reminder
on homogeneous vectors, we denote them by

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.280
tilde on top. We take the Cartesian vector,
in this case because it's 3-dimensional space,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.370
it's got 3 elements A, B and C. The homogeneous
version of that has got 4 elements A, B, C

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.800
and 1. We append a 1 to it. Here it is in
a very compact form. We have a point denoted

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.920
by a homogeneous vector with respect to frame
B and we can transform it to a point described

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.870
by a homogeneous vector with respect to frame
A. Relative pose is described by single 4

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.069
x 4 matrix. A mathematician would say that
this matrix belongs to the special Euclidean

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.150
group of dimension 3 and the short hand is
that T is an element of the set SE(3); 3 indicating

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.349
the dimension in this case 3.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.250
Instead of the abstract symbol ksi, we can
use a homogeneous transformation matrix, a

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.450
4 x 4 matrix. Compounding or composition
is simply a matrix-matrix product. To compound

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.500
2 poses, I simply multiply their representation
in terms of homogeneous transformations. Note

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.120
well that the inverse of a homogeneous transformation
is not equal to its transpose, that property

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.999
only belongs to the rotational component of
a matrix which is an orthogonal matrix. The

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:28.550
homogeneous transformation matrix is not an
orthogonal matrix. It's inverse is not equal

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.349
to its transpose. Finally, vector transformation
is simply a matrix-vector product.
