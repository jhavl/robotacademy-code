00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.440
If we have a stereo pair, an image that corresponds
to the left eye and an image that corresponds

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.920
to the right eye, if we can come up with a
mechanism for directing those two slightly

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.980
different images to the respective eyes, then
we have a very, very vivid sense of the three-dimensionality

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.599
of the scene and this is the underlying principle
of 3D movies, 3D television and so on.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.240
It's something human beings have been fascinated
with for the longest time. I really love this

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.399
movie poster in this scene from a cinema back
in the 1950's. It shows us that there’s

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.969
this long term human fascination with 3D movies.
It's not a recent phenomenon. The technology

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.539
keeps changing, but the underlying principle
is exactly the same. The fundamental problem

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.160
we need to address is how do we get different
image into our left eye and our right eye?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.030
Let’s have a look at some of the technologies
that have been developed over the years.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.559
In order to reproduce the really vivid 3D
perception that we get in everyday life, we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.030
need to use some rather elaborate mechanisms
to recreate that effect artificially.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.790
So the first one is back from probably early
last century and what this device does is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
takes an image which corresponds to an image
from the left eye and another image taken

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.720
from a position that corresponds to the right
eye.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.180
Then this lens mechanism here sends the left
image into my left eye and the right image

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.990
into my right eye. So if I hold this up to
my face, I see a really vivid three-dimensional

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.790
representation of the scene that was captured
more than 100 years ago.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.439
This is the first kind of stereoscope and
these things were really, really popular in

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.210
the early 1900s. So a slightly more modern
version of that technology is something from

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.729
the 1960s and this one has a number of stereo
image pairs on a little piece of cardboard

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.009
and a little clicker so I can move from one
picture to the other much more conveniently.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.509
If I hold this up to my head, again, I get a very vivid 3D perception of the scene that I’m looking at.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.739
Another approach to providing different images
into the left and right hand eyes, what’s

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.129
called the Anaglyph Technique and you look
at an anaglyph image through red and blue

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.870
glasses. What happens is that the left image
is printed in red and the right-handed image

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.340
is printed in blue and by putting on these
filtered glasses, the left image comes through

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.930
the red filter into my left eye. It does not
pass though the blue filter. So my right eye

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.480
doesn't see that. For the right-hand image,
the one that’s printed in blue, comes through

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.140
the blue filter into my right eye but not
into my left eye. So if I put this on and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.430
look at a printed anaglyph image or an anaglyph
image on a webpage, for instance, NASA has

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.700
lots of anaglyph images of Mars, we get a
very, very vivid 3D sensation.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.970
This is just one image from NASA’s collection
of 3D anaglyph images. The most recent Mars

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.000
Rovers all carry quite sophisticated stereovision
systems and the images are transmitted back

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to Earth, processed by NASA and turned into anaglyph form and made available through their website.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.330
What we don’t get though is a very full
representation of the colour because we’re

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.659
looking at it through red and blue glasses.
So it looks a bit monochromatic but the 3D

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.300
perception is really quite vivid. If you’ve
got access to a pair of anaglyph glasses,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.920
these are glasses with the red and blue lenses,
you might be interested to grab them, put them

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.740
on and have a look at these next few images. They contain some very vivid three-dimensional content.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.560
Another technique and one you see in 3D movies,
you can see Gravity or Avatar, Hobbit, something

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.739
like that, and you put on glasses like this,
what happens in the theatre is the left-hand

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.080
image is projected with light but it’s polarized
perhaps in the vertical direction and that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.790
light goes through this filter which lets
through polarized light into my right eye

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.739
but not into my left eye because this filter
is polarized in the horizontal direction.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.370
The right-hand image is projected with a vertical
polarization comes through this filter but

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.709
not into this filter. So when I put this on
my head in the cinema, I see a really wonderful

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.949
3D colourful representation of the scene that
was filmed.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.740
For home use, with three-dimensional TV’s,
the technology is a little bit different.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.150
What we use are these liquid crystal shutter
glasses. What happens now is that the television

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.660
presents the left and right images sequentially
about 100 times per second. We have left image,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.940
right image, left image, right image and the
lenses in these glasses are synchronized with

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.380
the TV so when the left image is projected,
this lens becomes clear and the right, this

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.949
one, is opaque. So I only see the left image
in my left eye. Then 1/100th of a second later,

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.820
the right image is projected on the TV; this
lens goes black and this one goes clear. So

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.770
with these on my head, I get a very vivid,
again colourful, and three-dimensional representation

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.169
of the scene through the TV.

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.190
The final approach is to do away with trying
to use colour glasses, filtered glasses, and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.310
shuttered glasses on my head and to project the left and right image directly into my eyes.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.590
So in some ways it’s a high-tech analog
of the old stereoscopic viewers like this

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.550
one and this one. So here is the state-of-the-art
head-mounted display. If I put this on my

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.759
head, the left image is projected through
this lens directly into my left eye and the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.729
right-hand image is projected through this
lens directly into my right eye.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.220
All of the techniques that we’ve looked
at require us to wear something on our head

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.680
and that’s not always very convenient. Maybe
we don’t have the particular glasses to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.500
hand or maybe we find that it gets in the
way of our everyday life.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.900
So there’s been quite a bit of work in trying
to create the stereo effect without needing

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.050
to have anything on your head, so one fairly
recent innovation is the technology shown

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.810
diagrammatically here. It requires that your
head is approximately the right distance away

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.479
from the screen and there is a system of lenses
which refract the light from the left-hand

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.500
image in the general direction of your left
eye and the right-hand image is refracted

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.270
in the general direction of your right eye.
