00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.990
We have talked about how important color is
to human beings, that we have thousands of

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.960
words to describe many, many different shades
of color.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.160
Color is clearly important to us; it helps
us in our everyday life to be able to describe

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.110
objects by their color.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.120
So where does this concept of color come from?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.660
There a number of parts of the process that
lead to you having a perception of color in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.430
your mind and what we are going to do is go
through those from the beginning to the end.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.581
At the start of the whole process we have
what we call an illuminant.

00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:41.310
An illuminant is a thing that omits light
and the light shines on the scene, shines

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.760
on the object that we are interested in and
we call this incoming light, we call that

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.320
the illuminance.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.440
So the illuminance is the light from the illuminant
that falls on the object that we are interested

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
in.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.260
Now the object reflects some of that light
and the light that comes from the object we

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.900
refer to as the luminance, we talk about the
luminance of the object.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.930
In this case we would refer to the luminance
of the apple, so light is coming in from our

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.290
illuminant, striking the apple, reflecting
off it and entering the eye of our observer.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.971
Some pretty amazing things happen within the
eye.

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:24.670
The incoming photons trigger a chemical reaction
in the rod and cone cells at the back of your

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.730
eye.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.830
They lead, in turn, to electrical impulses
which are transmitted through the optic nerve

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.200
to the visual cortex of your brain, which
is located in the back of your head, and that

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.120
leads to the perception of the color red.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.000
Which you would associate with the object
you are looking atâ€”in this case, the apple.
