00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.110
The last term we're going to look at is the
term 'C' and it represents the Coriolis and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.110
Centripetal torques that exists within a serial
link robot manipulator. It's often called

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.200
the velocity term because the C matrix multiplies
the vector Q dot, the vector of joint velocities.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.380
This is the torque that is due to gyroscopic
effects due to rotating joints within the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.910
robot manipulator. There are actually two
effects that are modelled by the matrix C and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.750
it's the Coriolis effect which is named after
the French scientist, mathematician Coriolis

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.960
and he did a lot of work on understanding
what goes on in rotating reference frames

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.410
and the other force represented by the matrix
C are centripetal torques.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.880
Once again we have our two link robot represented
symbolically and this time we're going to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.790
investigate the Coriolis and centripetal torques.
And that's done using the method called coriolis

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.269
and the arguments to that are the joint angles,
there they are and the joint velocities; Q1D and Q2D.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.340
It takes a moment to compute and this is the
Coriolis and centripetal matrix.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.320
It's a 2 x 2 matrix and we can see, once again that
it comprises a number of kinematic and dynamic

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.749
parameters of a robot and we can also see
that it's a function of the configuration

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.459
of a robot. Interestingly, in this case it’s
only a function of Q2.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.810
For a simple 2 link robot manipulator, the
C matrix looks something like this. We can

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.639
see that the elements are a function of the
joint angle, in this case just a single joint

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:43.560
angle. Joint 2 angle Q2 and also the velocities
of the two joints Q1 dot and Q2 dot.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.009
Now the torque, due to the Coriolis and centripetal
effects can be derived by multiplying the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.560
matrix C by the vector of joint velocities
and if we expand that out, we have the expression

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.529
for the Coriolis and centripetal talks acting
on Joint 1 and acting on Joint 2.

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:07.539
Let's consider the case where Joint 1 is not
moving that’s Q1 dot is equal to zero but

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.990
let's say that Joint 2 is moving so Q2 dot
is not equal to zero. Then although this term

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.200
here is equal to zero. This term here will
be finite, that is the motion of Joint 2 at

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.120
constant velocity is going to induce a torque
on Joint 1 and that's again something that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.690
the Joint 1 motion controller is going to
have to fight against, going to have to oppose

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.940
in order to keep Joint 1 stationary.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.130
And similarly we can see that for Joint 2
constant velocity motion of Joint 1 is going

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.870
to induce a Coriolis and centripetal effect
on Joint 2. Now if we look at these terms,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.140
we can see that some of them are a function
of a particular joint velocity squared and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.280
these are the centripetal talks and some of
them are a product of one joint velocity multiplied

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.130
by a different joint velocity and these are
the Coriolis terms. So this matrix C has got

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.140
some terms which are the products of velocities
of different joints and some are joint velocity

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.069
squared, Coriolis and centripetal effects.
