00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.449
Let's look now at the age profile of the world
population. What you can see here are a number

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:16.090
of curves, which are referred to as population
pyramids. I've got six of them here for six

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.730
different countries and you can see that they
have quite different shapes. On the left hand

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.519
side of each pyramid, we have a distribution
of the age of males. On the right hand side,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.039
we have the age distribution of females.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.100
Let's look at the population pyramid for Australia.
What we can see is that perhaps past the age

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.829
of sixty, the population of both males and
females starts to taper off and that's essentially,

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.390
the effect of people dying of old age. You
can see that around the age of thirty to thirty

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.149
five, there is a bit of a bump in the population
and that would reflect either a spike in the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.920
birth rate thirty to thirty five years ago
or perhaps, a surge in immigration into the country.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.920
If we look at the population pyramid for Japan,
we see that it has a very, very different

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.550
shape indeed. We can see a taper down here
and what that indicates is that the birth

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.540
rate in the country is falling off. We can
also see that the Japanese are very long lived.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.720
There are many more people aged above eighty
than there are in Australia. We can also see

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.070
that there is this large area of people aged
above effectively forty-five. This means that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.360
they have quite a large proportion of elderly
people in their society with not too many

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.110
young people coming in to replace them.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
The curve for Germany, you can see it's also
quite different. It's got this big bulge in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.729
the range fifty to sixty which indicates something
about a population boom that started nearly

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.619
sixty years ago.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.909
The population pyramid for China has got a
number of quite interesting lumps and bumps,

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.310
which probably reflect many events in the
history of that country.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.640
The population pyramid for India also has
a very unique shape and effectively, represents

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
the fact that the life expectancy in India
is much less than it is in countries such

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.240
as Australia, Germany, United States or Japan.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.930
Now, what I'm going to do is to highlight
a band of ages, the ages between twenty and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.320
sixty. These are working aged people in these
societies. So, people less than twenty are

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.260
generally being supported by their parents.
They're typically at school or at university.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.199
Those above sixty have retired and are being
supported either by the state or by their children.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:37.419
So, a really important concept in understanding
populations is what’s called the dependency

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:43.169
ratio; that's the ratio of the number of dependents,
that's children and older people to the number

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:50.229
of workers, the people who are earning a salary, doing a job and supporting the young and the old people.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:55.380
For dependency ratio, a low value is good.
The dependency ratios that are plotted here

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.500
are for Australia and we can see that they
achieved a minimum in the year 2010, that's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.169
when the dependency ratio was the best it
could possibly be. As we move forward in time,

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:12.010
the dependency ratio grows. In fact, it gets
worse, that means that there are more elderly

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.650
people and young people to be supported by
a smaller number of working aged people. So,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.190
the only way we can keep our society working
the same way as it has is we need each individual

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.880
person to become more productive or we could
add robotic workers to the society, to increase

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.570
the amount of work that's going to be done
without requiring more human beings.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.440
The bottom line is that in the future, if
we want to have the same standard of care

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.790
for young people and elderly people and it's
going to be provided by a smaller number of

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.690
working aged people, then those working aged
people need to be more productive. Each one

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.470
of those people needs to do more work than
people have to do today.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.930
So, that's what we have to look forward to.
Each working aged person having to do more

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.190
work than people did a few years ago. The
alternative for that is we introduce into

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.100
the mix, robotic technology that means we
introduce robotic workers. So, they either

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.630
do some of the work themselves or they help
the human workers to become more productive.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.549
Let's look here at health care versus age
and what we can see quite clearly is that

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.230
for very young people, they require certain
amount of health intervention and then for

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.470
the early years of their life, perhaps from
five through forty, they don't require too

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.830
much health intervention but above the age
of forty, people need on an individual basis,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.890
more health interventions. It basically means
elderly people require more health care.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.170
So, as our population gets older, graphs like
this are going to get much, much more extreme

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.960
and that presents a real challenge to us as
a society to provide the health care that

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.880
needs to be provided. If you've ever visited
a hospital, you know that they are incredibly

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.850
busy places. There’s all sorts of work going
on. There is work moving people from one ward

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.860
to another. There are surgeons performing
operations. There are people doing laundry.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.840
There are people doing cooking. All sorts
of activities happening in a hospital employ

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.960
a lot of people and that make it expensive.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.680
So perhaps, robot technology has a role to
play here. Robotics is already making quite

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.560
a significant impact in the area of surgery.
In fact, it's more technically teleoperation.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.690
What we can see here are some surgeons, teleoperating or controlling small robotic implements inside

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.250
the body of a patient over here. So, these
are the robot arms that are doing the work

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.300
inside the human body. These people here are
controlling those robotic arms.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.230
The advantage of doing this sort of surgery
is that the surgeons can be more productive

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.200
and because we make very small incisions in
the patients, they recover much more quickly

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.580
having to spend less time in hospital and
that's a net benefit to the health care system.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.530
Other sorts of robotic technology that are
being proposed for hospitals include instruments

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.430
that move themselves automatically from one
ward to another and robots that can pick people

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.300
up, perhaps lift them from a wheelchair into
a bed or from a bed into a wheelchair. A lot

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.570
of operations in hospital involve moving people
from one place to another. People are heavy

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.650
and will require quite strong people just
to move patients around.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.980
Humanoid robots such as Asimo shown here,
might be able to provide assistance to elderly

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.130
people in their own homes. If we can keep
people healthy and happy in their homes for

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.460
a longer period of time, then we reduce the
amount of time that they need to spend in

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.220
elderly care and that is a net advantage to
society. So perhaps, robotic helpers in the

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.010
home can assist people staying in their homes
for longer.
