00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.380
I mentioned early about the human fascination
with building machines in our own image. This

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.769
is an amazing project out of the Osaka University.
One of these characters is a Japanese robotic

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.319
researcher and the other one is a robot. See
if you can tell which one is which. Perhaps

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:25.359
the best-known humanoid robot is Asimo built
by Honda the car company.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.360
Here we see a pair of humanoid robots out
of a Chinese university playing ping-pong

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.679
with each other and apparently they're able
to do rallies that last up to a hundred and

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:57.079
seventy six strokes. We see some quite competent
behaviour in these humanoid robots and in the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.069
last one, the ability to walk, the ability
to use hand eye control to perform a complex

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.560
task like ping-pong.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.200
Robotic researchers are working on mimicking
almost all aspects of the human form. People

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.909
working on legged locomotion, there are people
working on hands and manipulation and eyes

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.890
and heads and so on, so bit by bit we're able
to mimic or copy different parts of the human

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.450
body and the really big challenge for us as
roboticists is how do we integrate all these

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.990
into one system that is reliable and can be
manufactured for a cost that is affordable

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.909
for people on the planet.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.079
Here is an example of a very human like robotic
hand. It's got four fingers and an opposable

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.759
thumb. It has force sensors so it was able to
control the forces that it exerts on an object.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.430
So it's able to manipulate delicate things
like the light bulb shown here. Bit by bit,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.729
over the decades, roboticists have built up
a large inventory of different technologies.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.149
We've been building hands, we've been building
vision systems that mimic the human sense

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.330
of sight. Weâ€™ve been building heads, we've
been building legs. We understand how to walk,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.470
we understand how to manipulate objects.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.540
So the big challenge for roboticists today
is how do we integrate all this component

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.980
technology in a way that is reliable, that
is affordable and that gives us the functionality

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.380
approaching that of a human being.
