00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.890
When we start talking about robots and the
need for sensors, the question that many people

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.699
ask is: ‘Why don’t we just use GPS, surely
that’s enough?’. GPS is everywhere—it’s

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.270
in our phones, it’s in our cars … it tells
us where we are. So let’s talk a little

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.660
bit about GPS.
Imagine we have a robot on the ground and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.670
it’s got a GPS receiver in its head. In
the sky are a number of satellites in low

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.119
earth orbit, and they are all sending radio
waves which the GPS receiver in the robot’s

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.860
head can pick up.
Using the time that it takes the radio wave

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.080
to travel from each satellite to the robot
we can work out the distance from each satellite to the robot.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.140
If we know enough of these distances—we know where the satellites are in space—

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.820
then we can work out where the robot is.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.950
That’s the fundamental principle of GPS.
Now these radio waves are at a very high frequency;

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.820
they are around about 1.5 gigahertz, and that’s
significant and we’ll talk about why that’s

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.629
significant shortly.
Imagine now we’re looking upwards from the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.850
robot. We’re looking up to the sky, and
there are a number of satellites that we can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.039
see. We only need four satellites in fact,
to work out where we are on the planet. That’s

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.450
the minimum requirement in order to get what’s
called a ‘fix’.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.130
Now imagine that our robot is in an urban
environment. Imagine we’re on a street in

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.649
Manhattan or something like that. So what
happens now is that some part of the sky is

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.170
obscured. We can’t see all of the satellites.
Now we can only see two satellites and that’s

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.319
not enough to obtain a fix. This is a very
common phenomenon, that’s why we have problems

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.729
with GPS in urban environments. But it occurs
in other environments as well. It can occur

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.200
perhaps in a very, very deep mining pit where
the walls of the pit obscure a significant

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.299
fraction of the sky.
Now imagine that we have our robot and it’s

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.630
at some big industrial complex. There are
large walls and chimneys and structures made

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.679
out of metal. Now what happens in this case
is that the signals from the satellite may

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.340
not travel in a direct line to the robot.
They may bounce off some of these metallic

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.710
structures before they hit the robot. The
problem with this is that the signals have

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
travelled a longer distance than the actual
distance between the robot and the satellite.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.210
The path length has increased through what’s
called ‘multi-pathed reflection’. So the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.990
GPS receiver within the robot doesn’t know
this, so it will come up with an erroneous

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.510
estimate of where the robot is located.
This is, again, quite a common problem with

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.440
GPS next to a big structure that reflects
radio waves. The GPS estimated robot position

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.540
can be significantly in error.
Now let’s consider another scenario. Consider

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.850
that our robot is underground, perhaps doing
some mining work, a really important domain

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.850
for robots. Now the problem that we have here
is that the radio waves from the satellite

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.710
cannot penetrate the earth.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.840
Another application where we might want to
use robots is underwater. And again we have

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.190
the same problem as we have in the underground
case. The radio waves at 1.5 gigahertz cannot

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.510
penetrate very far into water. They perhaps
penetrate a few millimetres. So a robot that’s

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.710
at any depth can make absolutely no use of
GPS information.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.180
Now let’s consider a situation we’re outdoors
but there are trees above the robot. The problem

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.390
we have here is actually very similar to the
last one. There is a lot of water in the leaves

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.170
of the trees, and particularly after it has
been raining then there’s a lot of the water

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.620
on the surface of the leaves. And this water
absorbs the 1.5 gigahertz radio waves from

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.620
the satellite, and they won’t penetrate.
So with heavy tree canopy GPS radio waves

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.020
are absorbed, and we’re not going to get
enough information for the robot to obtain

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.860
a fix.
But there’s another and perhaps deeper reason

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.530
why GPS is not the solution to all robotic
problems. Consider this kind of typical case

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.300
where I’ve got a robot and it wants to pick
up an object.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.680
So this robot wants to pick up that banana.
Now I can add a GPS receiver to the robot,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.819
so the robot now knows where it is in the
world. But it doesn’t really help, because

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.560
it doesn’t really know where the banana
is. So I can add a GPS receiver to the banana,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.349
and now the banana knows where it is; the
robot knows where it is. But it still hasn’t

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.930
helped with this problem of this robot knowing
where the banana is so that it can move and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.099
grasp it. So in order to get information about
the banana’s position to the robot I could

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:37.110
add a radio transmitter to this GPS receiver
on the banana, and I could add a receiver

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.770
to the robot. So now the robot knows where
the banana is, it has the coordinates of the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.499
banana; it knows where it is, and having those
two pieces of information, the robot can then

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:55.849
plan a path in order to get from here to there.
Now while this might work, the fundamental

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.879
problem is that every object that the robot
would want to pick up, work with and manipulate

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.430
needs to be fitted with this kind of instrumentation,
and clearly this is not the way we solve this

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.110
problem. If I want to pick up the banana I
simply reach out, I use my eyes to work out

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.699
where it is and guide my hand in order to
pick it up.
