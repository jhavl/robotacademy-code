00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's talk a little bit about ethics. Now
I'm an engineer, I'm not an ethicist but to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.850
me ethics has got some notion of right and
wrong and of course, right and wrong are not

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.009
necessarily always clear cut, sometimes the
answer is perhaps; it does depend. I also

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.519
think ethics is mixed up perhaps with ideas
of good and evil. It's a perhaps a more extreme

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.269
versions of right and wrong. But I think there
are also some very human centric aspects to

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.699
ethics. I think it's about respect to individuals;
it's about justice to individuals. And I think

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.829
there's perhaps also an element of responsibility
in there. What are the responsibilities of

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.710
individuals to society and what's the responsibility
of society to its individuals?

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.429
In a little while, I'm going to have a conversation
with a friend of mine who knows much much

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.749
more about ethics than I do and we're going
to have some conversations around ethics and

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.699
in particular ethics as it applies to robotics.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.309
So what are some of the issues where ethics
and robotics intersect? Well perhaps one is

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.660
in the area of warfare. An interesting statistic
is that perhaps one in fifty U.S war fighters

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.470
is now a robot. Now what are the ethical considerations around machines inflicting harm on soldiers,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.480
human soldiers belonging to enemy forces?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.670
Another issue is privacy and it's been a lot
of controversy lately about how robots in

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.900
particular drones are infringing on people's
privacy. So imagine how you would feel if

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.520
a drone came up to your window and peered
inside your house. Another scenario is much

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.210
in the news lately and that's self driving
cars, perhaps you might think of them as robotic

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.250
cars, and the issue is that if one of these
cars has an accident and perhaps it injures

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.180
or kills the driver of the robotic car or
a bystander on the road or the driver of another

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.130
car; whose fault is that? That's a pretty
complex question.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.520
Another thing that we might like to think
about is robots caring for young people and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.560
also for elderly people. In many countries,
with an aging population there is a need for

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.640
people to help the elderly people and if there
are not enough working age people to do that,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
then is that a job that could be or should
be fulfilled by robots?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.650
The same thing perhaps happens at the other
end of the spectrum. Is it proper or appropriate

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.150
to have the youngest members of our society,
young children, raised and nurtured by machines

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.230
rather than by human beings?

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.240
Another issue that gets talked about a lot
with robots is about jobs. Imagine a future

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.620
when nobody has to work because robots are
doing all the work, then how do we get the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.980
money that we need to buy food and put a roof
over our head?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.480
Perhaps we could radically restructure society
so all of those things come to us for free

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.010
and robots do all the work. Even if we could
build that Utopia, what would we do if we

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.680
didn't need to work? And I love this quote
by Voltaire; he says that work spares us from

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.540
three evils; boredom, vice and need. So perhaps
robots could provide everything that we need

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.040
but I'm sure human beings would get bored
if they didn't have to work. I know that I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.510
would.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.880
We talked about Isaac Asimov in the very first
lecture in this course. In particular his

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.550
three laws of robotics, which were introduced
in the short story called 'Run around' in

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.000
1941. These three rules in code a set of robot
behaviours and it seems, certainly at face

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.470
value, that if robots obeyed these three laws
then the chance for robots and humans to get

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.290
into any kind of strife or disagreement would
be very low.
