00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's recap what we've learnt about solving
the inverse Kinematic problem for particular

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.529
robot arms. So far we've looked at the analytic
solution and that involved us creating a model

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.249
of the robot's joints and links. We write
down the equations for the forward kinematics

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:25.169
of the robot arm and that's relatively a straightforward
thing to do.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.369
Next comes the hard part, where we need to
write down a lot of equations in attempt to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.110
solve for the unknown joint variables and
that requires some human insight. Often when

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.770
you're trying to do this, you'll find yourself
going down some blind alleys before you come

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.989
back out and determine the right way to get
to the solution.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.730
This process can be automated, using a computer
algebra package; you can write software that

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.949
will solve the inverse kinematics for certain
classes of robot arms. The great advantage

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.190
of the analytic solution is that it explicitly
shows the multiple configurations that the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.380
robot arm can be in. So for our two link manipulator,
we showed two configurations with the middle

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.590
joint either below the diagonal line or above
the diagonal line.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.750
For the Puma 560 robot, we showed configurations
where it's like a left handed person or a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.780
right handed person and so on. The multiple
configurations come out explicitly when you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.119
solve the analytic equations.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.119
Another advantage of the analytic solution
is you end up writing expressions for the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.350
joint angles in terms of the end effector
pose and they are quite compact and that means

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.040
that they are very fast to execute.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.619
The problem becomes increasingly difficult
as the number of joints in the robot increases.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.219
In an earlier section we derived the solution
for a simple two joint robot and already that

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.189
took quite a number of slides in order to
come up with the solution. What comes to our

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.350
rescue is that over many decades, smart people
have determined the inverse kinematic solutions

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.590
for particular robots or for particular classes
of robots, so they've done the hard work of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.310
deriving the solutions and these have been
published in the literature.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.900
So if you've got a particular robot and you're
looking for a solution, go and hit up the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.569
literature and see if somebody has already
solved this problem for you.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.629
When you're trying to determine the inverse
kinematics for a six degree of freedom robot,

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.260
it's really, really useful to have what's
called a "Spherical Wrist." Now a spherical

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.459
wrist is one in which the three wrist joint
axes all intersect at a common point, as shown

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.519
in this sketch here. Almost all industrial
robots have a spherical wrist. It's quite

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.940
a complex mechanism but it leads to great
simplicity when it comes to determining the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.739
inverse kinematics of the robot.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.620
In fact what it does is allow us to partition
the problem into two. It allows us to solve

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.930
for the position of the robot’s end effector,
the XYZ co-ordinate and then separately to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.190
solve for the orientation of the robot's end
effector, that is the orientation that could

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.170
be expressed in terms roll, pitch, yaw angles
or in terms of Euler angles. But what happens

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.650
if it's not possible to determine the analytic
solution?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.930
Perhaps the robot doesn't have a spherical
wrist or what if it's just too hard to figure

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.049
out or you can't be bothered to go through
the pages of algebra required to determine

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.610
the solution? Well there is an alternative
and that is to find a numerical solution to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.980
the problem. We can always determine the forward
kinematics of a robot, that's relatively straight

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.590
forward to do as we showed in the previous
lecture. If we know the desired pose of our

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.480
robot, which I'm going to call Ksi star, then
all we have to do is adjust the joint angles

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.319
until the pose given to us by the forward
kinematics Ksi equals the desired value Ksi

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.909
star. So you could think of it perhaps as
having a large number of dials, each dial

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.209
represents a particular joint angle and I’m
just going to adjust all of those dials until

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.049
the robot's end effector pose equals the pose
that I want. A more formal way of describing

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.010
a problem like this is to represent it as
an optimization problem.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.840
What I want to do is minimize the relative
pose which is given by the forward kinematics

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.250
of the robot compounded with the inverse of
the desired pose and I want to know the joint

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.720
angles that cause this minimum.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.480
We've mostly talked about serial linked robots
and these are robots formed by a chain of

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.000
links, starting at the base of the robot we
have a link, that link holds up the second

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.530
link, which holds up the third link and so on.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.630
An alternative structure for a robot is what's
called a parallel link robot and that's shown

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.220
here on the right. They have the advantage
that all the motors are placed in the base.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.260
This has advantages over a serial link robot
where each motor has to hold up not only the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.700
next link but also the motor that drives the
link beyond that.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.960
Parallel link robots are also very, very ridged
and they're capable of very high speed motion.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.350
They're used for high speed, very precise,
pick and place operations. So for a serial

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.670
link robot, the kinematics - the forward kinematics
is very easy to determine, very easy to write

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.410
down. However for a parallel link robot, the
forward kinematics is very, very complex and

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.720
an analytical form may not even exist. For
a serial link robot, the inverse kinematics

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.530
is typically complex and analytic form may
not exist. However for most parallel link

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.210
robots, the inverse kinematics is actually
very easy to determine and an analytic form

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.600
always exists. So there is some complementarity
between serial and parallel link robots; one

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.820
has an easy forward kinematics, the other
has an easy inverse kinematics.
