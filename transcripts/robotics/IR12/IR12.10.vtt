00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.879
In this section, I'd like to speculate about
the further future. I'm sure everybody's heard

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:15.170
of Moore's law. It was articulated by Gordon
Moore of Intel in 1971. He was looking at

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.180
the number of transistors that they could
put on a silicon chip and he was plotting

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.660
how that number of transistors per chip increased
over time.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.230
And he showed in the very early days of silicon
chip technology that the transistor count

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.000
doubled every two years. In the four decades
since then, that trend has continued and this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.980
graph shows a line fitted to the transistor
density of a number of micro-processes that

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.140
have been developed over that period of time.
So Moore's law is all about the number of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.810
transistors per chip.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.220
This is an interesting graph from Ray Kurzweil.
And what he's plotted here is the number of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.030
calculations per second that you can get for
a thousand dollars. And he's plotted that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.500
against time. And this curve is interesting
because it's not linear. In fact, it's exponential.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.770
And what Ray has done is taken a number of
data points and plotted them and fitted in

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.909
exponential to that. Now, what's really interesting
about this graph are the horizontal dashed

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.340
lines which correspond to the computational
capability of various life forms.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.100
So he has a horizontal line for an insect
brain, a mouse brain, a human brain, and all

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.700
human brains. Right now, we're about here.
And if this graph is correct, it indicates

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.579
that for a thousand dollars, I could buy the
computational equivalent of one mouse brain.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.639
By they year 2030, I should be able to buy
a computer for $1000 equivalent to a human

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:48.659
brain. The most interesting of all is it by
the year 2050, for a thousand dollars, I can

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.429
buy the computational equivalent of all human
brains on the planet.

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.919
The year 2050 is not that far away. For many
of you, it will be within your working life.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:03.979
So there will be profound implications if
we can have this much computational power

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.209
available for so few dollars.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.960
This graph plots the power density of various
microprocessors against their clock frequency.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.370
And we can see that over time, we're moving
in this direction, we are moving towards higher

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.530
and higher power densities and higher and
higher clock frequencies.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.680
Down here, we can see the human brain. We
see that it has an impressively low power

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.520
density and it operates at a very, very low
clock frequency. We can argue that where we're

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.560
going with silicon computational technology,
we're going in the wrong direction. We're

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.250
going further and further away from the amazing
capability of the human brain.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.510
Now it's possible to simulate human brain
on a supercomputer. Apparently, these simulations

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.290
run at something like 1/500 of real time.
And if we were to scale those up so that they

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.470
would operate in real time, the computer would
be big and require like 12 gigawatts of electricity.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.180
You can power New York with that much electricity.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.810
So clearly, if we're trying to get human-like
intelligence in robots, following these traditional

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.370
approach is going to require computers that
are massive, expensive, and consume phenomenal

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.520
amounts of electricity. What can we do to
get around that?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.850
Well, some people are looking at different
computing architectures, called: neuromorphic

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.620
computing, modelled on the neuro connectionist
structure of human brains. So these are like

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.400
neural networks on steroids and embedded in
custom silicon chips. So perhaps, this is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.760
the future hardware in which we will create
the intelligence that will power future robots.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.140
Following on from this biological approach
to computation, learning from nature about

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.069
the way brains do computation is to consider
the perhaps most important biological sensing

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.540
invention which is vision.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.510
Vision is an amazing sense shared by almost
all creatures on the planet. The sense of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.600
vision has evolved multiple times independently
and in parallel. And today, there is a vast

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.200
variety of different sorts of eyes on creatures
on the planet.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.739
Here we see just a few of them. We see the
pinhole camera eye of a nautilus, the multiple

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.099
eyes of spider, the compound eyes of an insect,
the eyes of a bird, the small reflector-based

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.430
eyes of a scallop, the eyes of an octopus.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.020
Eyes are everywhere. They are really important
sensing modality for all living creatures

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.330
and I believe very strongly it is an important
sensing modality for robots.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.050
So if you're interested in vision, the sense
of vision, and how robots might exploit that,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.789
then I invite you to join me in the follow
up MOOC, Robotic Vision, which is coming soon.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.039
So what are the important take-home messages
from this six weeks that we've been looking

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.520
at robots? I think the first message I like
you to take home is that robots are real.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.020
They're not all like the fictional robots
that you read about in books or you see in

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.340
television and in movie theatres. There are real robots out there doing useful things on the planet today.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.980
These robots are diverse in form and function.
They don't look like the humanoid robots we

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.669
see in fiction. They might look like cars,
they might look like tractors or airplanes

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.029
or submarines, but they are robots because
they follow this fundamental paradigm of sensing,

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.770
planning, and acting so that they can achieve
a goal. That's what robots are.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.740
The functionality of robots is improving incredibly
rapidly and that's driven by improvements

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.620
in technology, computational technology, and
the ready availability of amazing sensors;

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.680
inertial sensors, visual sensors, and so on.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.740
But there are some really important non-technical
take-home messages here. And in this lecture,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.740
we’ve talked a lot about the big challenges
that confront all of us as a society and these

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.979
are problems around population and food and
jobs and care for the elderly.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.610
These are massive challenges that our societies
face and I really believe that robots are

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.339
part of the solution to these challenges.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.939
But as a roboticist’s I believe it's important
that we think much more widely about the implications

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.699
of the technology that we are developing.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.749
Yes, I believe robotics really is the answer
to many of these challenges but we do need

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:27.749
to be aware of the way the technology will
be used. We need to understand about the ethics,

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.999
we need to understand about the sorts of concerns
and considerations that general members of

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:41.499
the public hold. So it's our responsibility, as roboticist’s to employ and deploy this technology wisely.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.140
All right, that is the end of the MOOC, it's
the end of the first MOOC that I have ever

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.749
done. It's the end of Introduction to Robotics.

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:57.479
If you're interested in Robotic Vision, then
please join me soon for the sequel, the Robotic

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.210
Vision MOOC, which should be coming your way
sometime soon.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.639
I hope that you've learned a lot in the MOOC
and I hope you've had some fun along the way

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.529
with the learning. And if you did the project,
I hope you learned a lot by getting your hands

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.509
dirty and building a machine that does something
useful and does something functional, your

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.900
first steps into robotics.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.509
It's a fascinating field. It's a field that's
going to go very far and very fast so you're

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.629
on the on-ramp to a future in robotics.

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:33.369
I've had a lot of fun doing the MOOC but it's
been an enormous amount of work. It's taken

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:38.360
about two years of my life to produce these
two MOOCs and I couldn't have done it without

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.009
the help of an awful lot of people.

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:46.529
These a very passionate, committed, and enthusiastic
people who in behind the scenes helping me

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:53.399
to take the raw ideas from my head and deploy
it with wonderful graphics and wonderful videos

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:58.759
so as to give you a sort of more enjoyable
learning experience. So, I'm very grateful

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.639
to all of those people.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.399
Anyway, for now, thank you very much for participating
in the course. I hope you enjoyed it.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.580
Thanks, and bye.
