00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
We’re now going to describe some slightly
mathematical concepts but they’re very useful,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.650
so bear with me.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.080
So far, when we’ve been talking about robots,
we’ve been talking a lot about the joint

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080
angles.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.480
What we’re going to do now is to generalize
that concept and we’re going to refer to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.869
generalize joint coordinates.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.779
Now, for most robots where the joints are
revolute, that is their rotating time joints,

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.900
then their generalize joint coordinate is
simply the joint angle.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.030
But, for those small number of robots that
have got a sliding joint also known as a prismatic

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.949
joint, then the generalize joint coordinate
then would be a length, the length of that

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.400
sliding joint.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.309
So, generalize joint coordinate is simply
a way that we can deal with robot joints that

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.299
either rotate or slide.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.670
So, the set of all joint coordinates for the
robot we referred to as the joint configuration.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.590
It’s a vector and typically denoted by the
symbol Q. And, the length of the vector is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.270
N and N is the number of joints.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.490
So, joint configuration Q is a vector of length
N and the elements of that vector are either

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.409
an angle or a length.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.479
The joint angle vector belongs to a space,
the space C.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.329
We refer to this as the configuration space.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:34.659
The joint configurations belong to the set
C and C is the set of all possible joint configurations.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.420
Now, C is a subset of the N dimensional real
number space.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.950
The other space that’s really important
when we’re talking about robots is the space

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.390
of all possible end effector poses and we
refer to this by the symbol T. We say that

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.150
the end effector pose ksi E belongs to the
set T, the set of all possible end effector

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.150
poses.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.350
In two dimensions, T is a subset of all possible
translations and rotations.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.240
And, the reason that it’s a subset is that
the robot has only got finite reach.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.879
It can’t reach out to the horizon.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:21.220
For example, so T is a subset of all possible
positions and orientations in two dimensions.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.110
For example, we’ve looked at robots where
the end effector pose is simply described

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.420
by the coordinates X and Y.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.530
We’ve also looked at some robots where the
end effector pose is described by the position

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.170
X and Y and by the orientation Theta.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.090
In three dimensions, we would say that T is
a subset of SE3, the set of all possible positions

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.030
and orientations in three dimensional space.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.299
And, we’ve, again, look at some specific
examples where the end effector pose is described

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.239
just in terms of its position, X, Y and Z,
some robots where the end effector pose is

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.650
described by position X, Y and Z and a single
pitch angle.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.760
We’ve also looked at some robots whose end
effector can be described in terms of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.120
position X, Y and Z and orientation roll,
pitch and yaw angles for example.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.239
These are all subsets of SE3.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.879
The next important consideration then is the
dimensions of these different spaces, the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.390
task space, the space in which we describe
the pose of the end effector, and the configuration

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.950
space in which we describe the joint coordinates
of the robot.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.410
We say that a robot has got so many degrees
of freedom and that’s equal to the number

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.189
of joints the robot has and that’s the dimension
of its configuration space.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:46.230
So, if a robot has got three joints, then
we say that its configuration space has got

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.730
three dimensions.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.440
Similarly, we could talk about the degrees
of freedom in the task space and that’s

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.790
equal to the dimension of the task space T.
Consider the pose of a simple planar robot.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.120
Its end effector pose is described simply
by the two coordinates X and Y.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.209
In this case, the dimension of a task space
is 2.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.830
If it’s a planar robot with three joints,
then the end effector pose can be described

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.079
by the X and Y position and the orientation
Theta.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.310
In this case, we would say that the dimension
of a task space is 3.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.450
It’s described by a three-dimensional vector.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.720
For a three-dimensional robot whose end effector
pose is described by the position, coordinates

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.160
X, Y and Z, the dimension of its task space
is also 3.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.060
The robot that has got X, Y, Z position and
also a pitch angle, dimension of its task

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.360
space is 4.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.650
And, for something like an industrial robot
whose end effector pose is described by position

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.110
X, Y, Z and orientation which could be described
by three angles, for instance, roll, pitch,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.710
yaw angles, the dimension of its task space
is 6.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.320
In the three-dimensional world in which we
live and which the robots live, it’s not

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.740
possible to have a task space dimension be
given 6.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.880
Now, the really important constraint is that
in order to reach all of the task space, the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.940
dimension of the configuration space should
be greater than or equal to the dimension

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.050
of the task space.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.550
To make this concrete, let’s look again
at the 2-degree freedom arm which we should

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.390
be quite familiar with by now.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.100
The end effector pose is an element of the
task space and the task space is a subset

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.380
of the two-dimensional space of real numbers.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.680
End effector pose can be described by a pair
of two real numbers.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.580
The configuration space for this robot is
a vector that comprises Q1 and Q2, the two

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.030
joint angles.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.470
The configuration space is also a subset of
the two-dimensional space of real numbers

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.030
because the joint configuration can be described
by a pair of real numbers, that is Q1 and

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.390
Q2.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.590
For the 3-degree of freedom arm, the end effector
pose is described by three numbers, X, Y and

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.590
Theta.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.970
So, we say now that the task space is a subset
of the set of all possible positions and the

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.690
subset of all possible orientations which
we denote by S. The configuration space is

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:20.110
a vector comprising Q1, Q2 and Q3 and that
is a subset of the three dimensional space

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.540
of real numbers.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.530
By now, I’m sure you’re getting the hang
of this.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.150
In this case, the task space is a subset of
r cubed, the set of three-dimensional real

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.150
numbers.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.910
And, the configuration space is also a subset
of three-dimensional space of real numbers.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.760
A Cartesian Gantry robot is a special case
because the joint coordinates directly map

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.680
on to the end effector pose.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.890
The joint coordinates are in fact the lengths
X, Y and Z.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.630
A 4-degree of freedom SCARA robot arm has
an end effector pose described by a position

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.340
X, Y and Z and a yaw angle.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.160
So, we would say that its task space is a
subset of r cubed, the set of all possible

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.290
positions, and the set of all possible orientations.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:15.130
Its configuration space is a four-dimensional
quantity and it comprises the three rotational

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.060
joint angles and a vertical displacement of
the tool.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.700
A 4-degree of freedom parallel link robot,
again, has a four-dimensional task space.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:31.110
It’s able to control the position and orientation
of the end effector and it has a four-dimensional

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.600
configuration space.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.540
There are four motors located at the base
connected by links to the end effector.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.620
The four joint educational robot that we looked
at before has a four-dimensional task space

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.920
which can be described by a position X, Y,
Z and a pitch angle, and its configuration

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.340
is also four-dimensional because there are
four rotational joints in this robot.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.560
The same thing applies for an arm of the NAO
robot.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:06.260
For a 6-degree of freedom arm such as shown
here, the task space is a subset of SE3, the

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.190
set of all possible positions in three-dimensional
space and the set of all possible orientations

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.170
in three-dimensional space.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.260
The configuration space of all these robots
is also six-dimensional.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.470
They all have six joints or 6 degrees of freedom.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.650
The industrial robot and the space shuttle
arm have got six rotational joints.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:32.330
Whereas, the Stanford arm has got five rotational
joints and one sliding joint.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.390
This is a very special case.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.830
This is a robot with a very large number of
rotational joints.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.240
The task space of this robot is exactly the
same as the robots on the previous slide.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.279
The end effector pose is described by its
position and by its orientation.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.199
It’s got six dimensions.

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:53.459
But, the configuration space for a robot like
this could be quite massive.

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:57.700
I don’t actually know how many joints this
robot’s got, but I’m guessing that it’s

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.769
got a hundred joints.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:04.540
So, I’m going to say that its configuration
space is a subset of the 100-dimensional space

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.839
of real numbers.

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:12.350
So, in this case, the dimension of the configuration
space is greater than the dimension of the

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.920
task space.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.330
We call this a redundant robot.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.370
An advantage of the redundant robot is that
the tool-tip can achieve any position and

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.580
orientation just like a 6-degree of freedom
industrial robot does, but with its additional

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.800
degrees of freedom, it can also control the
shape of the arm.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.709
So, it can control the pose of the end effector
and the shape of the arm.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:41.740
An industrial robot with only six joints can
only control the pose of the end effector.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.579
It can’t choose an arbitrary configurational
shape of its arm.

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:52.279
Another way that we describe robot arms is
in terms of a configuration string and this

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:58.040
is a string of characters, one character per
joint and the character is either an R for

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.259
a rotational joint or P for a prismatic or
sliding joint.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:07.860
So, here we can see the configuration strings
for three quite different sorts of robot.
