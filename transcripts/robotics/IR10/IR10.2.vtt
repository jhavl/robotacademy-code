00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.710
As I mentioned a moment ago, actuators are
the devices that actually move the robot joints.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.950
And there are a number of different types
of actuators in common use for robotics. A

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.199
good definition of an actuator is it is a
device that causes motion and it can cause

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.869
linear motion or rotary motion. On the top
here, we have a linear actuator and the shaft

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.609
of that linear actuator moves backwards and
forwards along a line. The more common form

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.430
of electric motor has a rotary output. The
output of an actuator could be considered

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.210
as either a speed or a force. That is, for
a particular input, the motor might adopt

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.280
a particular speed or it might exert a particular
force or torque in the rotational case.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.830
There are many different types of actuators
and they vary in the types of underlying physics

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.400
that’s used to cause the motion. The most
common types of actuators are hydraulic which

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.970
use compressed oil to cause the motion, pneumatic
which use compressed air to cause the motion,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.400
and electric which use electric current and
magnets to cause the motion.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.659
Hydraulic actuators are very common in heavy
machineries such as used in construction and

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.229
in the mining industry. They are very compact
devices that are capable of generating very

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.150
high forces and that’s important when I
want to pull a bucket of an excavator through

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.150
the ground or I want to lift up many, many
tons of earth and stones.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.859
The hydraulic actuators are the cylindrical
devices you see in this image. Up close, you

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.189
can see a large cylinder with some hoses going
to it and a shiny rod sticking out one end

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.870
that moves backwards and forwards. A hydraulic
actuator is really a very simple device. The

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.200
cylindrical body has got two ports where compressed
oil enters and leaves and then, there is the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
moving part, the rod which moves backwards
and forwards and exerts a force on the machine

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.329
or on the environment.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.069
A simple schematic of a hydraulic actuator
looks something like this. Down the bottom,

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.000
we have the cylinder itself. Inside that,
there is a piston which is attached to the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.469
rod which is the piece that does the work.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.080
There is a valve assembly and high-pressure
oil from the pump enters the valve and oil

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.030
leaves the valve and returns to the pump.
The hydraulic actuator converts oil pressure

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.930
to a linear force. If I apply a positive signal
to the valve and oil flows as shown by the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.540
black arrows, and the piston moves to the
right. Oil enters the left port of the cylinder

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.320
and it exits from the right hand port of the
cylinder.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.470
If the area of the piston is A and if the
pressure of the oil is P, then the force of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.760
the piston is P x A. And because the oil pressure
is so high, the force that can be exerted

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.140
by a hydraulic actuator is very, very large.
If I apply negative signal to the valve, then

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.440
the oil flows in the opposite direction and
the piston moves to the left. If I apply a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.090
zero signal to the valve, then all the ports
are blocked and this means that no oil can

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.780
enter or leave the hydraulic cylinder. Because
the oil is virtually incompressible, this

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.170
means that the piston is effectively locked
and it can’t move left or right.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.980
Although the linear hydraulic actuator is
by far the most common, there are also rotary

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.380
hydraulic motors such are shown here in the
motor which is driving this caterpillar track.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.980
You can think of it essentially as an oil-driven
turbine or paddle wheel.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.250
The hydraulic actuators are very compact and
can exert a lot of force. But in order to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.320
use a hydraulic actuator, you need a lot of
other kit. First of all, you need valves to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.000
control the direction of oil flow. You need
a compressor to supply the high-pressure oil

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.710
and for large systems, you need a chiller
to cool the oil after it’s been compressed.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.070
Often you will have an accumulator that holds
high-pressure oil and there is always an awful

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.010
lot of hoses. Way back in 1984, I was involved
in developing this flexible manufacturing

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.650
cell and it contained two robots in addition
to a lot of other equipment. There is the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.710
electric Puma 560 robot that we’ve met
a number of times before in this course and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.710
in the foreground is this very large hydraulically-powered
Cincinnati Milacron T3 robot.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.350
Back in the day, hydraulics was the only technology
that could be used to create a robot that

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.850
was able to lift very large payloads. Since
then, there has been massive improvements

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.740
in electric motor technology and there are
virtually no hydraulically-powered manufacturing

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.040
robots in existence today.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.440
Pneumatic actuators have a lot of similarity
to hydraulic actuators. And here we see a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.010
linear pneumatic actuator. Instead of compressed
oil, the pneumatic system uses compressed

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.330
air. Just like the hydraulic system, you need
a lot of other kit. You need to have valves,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.680
you need to have compressors, you need to
have accumulators and of course, you need

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.340
to have an awful lot of hoses. As an alternative
to the linear pneumatic actuator, it’s possible

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.020
to create an artificial muscle. These devices
directly convert air pressure to a linear

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.700
force. There’s no piston involved.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.990
And here we can see a large number of artificial
muscles connected by tendons to the fingers

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.250
on this robotic hand.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.890
The artificial muscle contains a flexible
chamber or bag. As air is pumped into the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.440
chamber, the chamber gets wider and it also
gets shorter. And we can see that the overall

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.710
length of the muscle has reduced as it is
inflated. One characteristic of these artificial

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.820
muscles just like our own muscles is that
they can only pull, they can’t push. In

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.940
order to make an effective actuation system,
we use them in what we called antagonistic

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.389
pairs. You can see that illustrated here.
As I pressurize one muscle, it gets shorter

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:37.330
and the wheel at the top rotates to the right.
As I depressurize that muscle and pressurize

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.780
the other muscle, it gets shorter and the
wheel at the top rotates towards the left.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.020
These artificial muscles have to be used in
pairs.
