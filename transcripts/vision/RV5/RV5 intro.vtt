00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.119
Today we're going to talk about a problem,
which is really at the heart of robotic vision.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.560
Robots are relatively simple machines. If
we consider the case of an industrial robot,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.929
one that's got six joints, we can control
that by simply specifying six velocities or

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.260
speeds. We specify the speed of each of its
motors and the robot can do any kind of action.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.460
A wheeled mobile robot, we control by specifying
simply two velocities; that's the velocity

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.920
at which it drives forward and the velocity
at which is turns. So we've got a problem

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.890
because the amount of data that comes out
of a camera is of the order of 10's of millions

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.320
of pixels per second; 10's of millions of
numbers per second. But we need only two or

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.850
six, a very small number, in order to actually
control the robot. It's like trying to drink

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.850
out of a fire hose; massive amount of data
coming out of the camera, small amount of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.150
data needed to control the robot. So to get
around this problem we perform a technique

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.670
called "Feature Extraction" and what we're
trying to do is find the essence of the image;

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
the most important information in the image,
we can feed directly to our robot.
