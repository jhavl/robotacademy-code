00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
This expression should be pretty familiar
to you by this point. This is the rigid body

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.910
equations of motion of a serial link robot
manipulator. We have an inertia term; Coriolis

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.110
and centripetal term; gravity term; the torque
applied the robot; joint acceleration; and

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.040
joint velocity.
This expression is also known as the inverse

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.039
dynamics. We can think of it as a function
that maps the motion of the robot Q, Q-dot

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.890
and Q-dot-dot, to the torque that needs to
be applied to the robots' joints. We take

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.500
this expression and re-arrange it. We end
up with an expression for Q-dot-dot, and we

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.320
can integrate Q-dot-dot with respect to time
to get Q-dot, the joint velocity and we can

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.290
integrate it again to get the joint position.
This set of equations is referred to as the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.610
forward dynamics. This is a function that
maps the torque that we applied to the robot

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.440
to the joint position, velocity and acceleration.
So, these forward dynamics are used to simulate

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.940
robot motion. If I know the torques and forces
that I'm going to apply to the robot manipulator

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.450
and then I can compute Q, Q-dot and Q-dot-dot
as a function of time.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.530
Let's have a look at how we can use the forward
dynamics to simulate the motion of a complex

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.850
6-axis robot like the PUMA 560. I'm going
to start by loading a model of the PUMA 560

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.749
into my workspace as we've done a number of
times before and I'm going to invoke a Simulink

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:36.429
model that is provided with the Robotics Toolbox,
and this is what it looks like. It's quite

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:43.609
a simple model. It contains a robot with no
Coulomb friction, and connected to an animation

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.200
or plotting block. And the robot is driven
by zero torques. So if you imagine a robot

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.900
sitting in a normal configuration and I turn
off all the joint torque, the robot is going

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.630
to collapse under its own weight.
So, I can run that simulator and here we see

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.080
the PUMA robot and it's collapsing under gravity,
and because of the joint friction, the energy

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.299
is rapidly dissipated and the robot is left
in a downward pointing configuration.
