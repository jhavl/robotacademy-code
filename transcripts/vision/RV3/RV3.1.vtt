00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.299
A very useful and concise way of describing
the grey levels within an image is using a

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.830
tool called a histogram.
Here I have a contrived and low resolution

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.140
image, where the pixel grey values vary between
0, which is black, and 10, which is white.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.350
We can consider the histogramming process
as a sorting process. I am going to take the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.849
first pixel, which has got a grey scale value
of 6, and I am going to drop it into the bin

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.370
for pixels with a value of 6. And I am going
to take the next pixel which has got a value

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.650
of 10, and I am going to drop it into the
bin for pixels of value of 10, and so on.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.370
And we repeat this process on and on until
we have coloured all of the pixels in the

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.140
image.
And we have this histogram. At a glance this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.330
histogram tells us some very interesting things
about the image. If all of the pixels are

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.049
at the left-hand side of the histogram, this
tells us that it is a very dark image. Conversely,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.089
if all of the pixels are at the right-hand
side of the histogram, this tells us that

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.559
it is a very bright image.
You have very likely encountered histograms.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.420
They are commonly displayed in the viewfinder
of a camera. What we are seeing here is the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.100
viewfinder of an iPhone camera app and we
can see the histogram here on the display.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.930
The left-hand side of the histogram corresponds
to the dark pixels, and the right-hand side

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.860
of the histogram corresponds to bright pixels.
If I move the camera from this view to down

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.460
underneath my desk where it is all very dark,
we can see that there are an increasing number

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.310
of dark pixels in the scene. As I bring the
camera up from underneath the desk and point

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.110
it out the window where it is very bright,
we see the distribution of pixels moving more

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.590
towards the bright end of the histogram.
If I repeat the process, but this time I have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.640
the camera set to automatic exposure control,
what happens now is that the software within

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.390
the camera is trying to keep the histogram
balanced. It is trying to keep an even mixture

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.010
of dark pixels and bright pixels, so that
the average is somewhere in the middle. And

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.860
the behaviour this time is quite different,
when we look under the desk, we can see the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.120
wires and the carpet.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.820
When we look out the window, we can now quite clearly see the world outside.
