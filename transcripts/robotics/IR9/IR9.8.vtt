00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.330
In a much earlier lecture, we introduced the
notion of roll, pitch, yaw angles. It’s

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.699
an intuitive way to think about the orientation
of a body in space and we can think about

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.939
it as the product of a number of elementary
rotations. It’s a rotation around the x-axis

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.140
by the roll angle, a rotation around the y-axis
by the pitch angle, and a rotation around

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.440
the z-axis by the yaw angle.
Now, we could take the derivative of this

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.039
expression and we obtain a relationship for
the rate of change of the rotation matrix

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.170
in terms of some elementary rotation matrices.
The derivatives of some elementary rotation

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.590
matrices, and the derivative of the roll angle,
pitch angle and yaw angle which are here denoted

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.441
by r dot, p dot and y dot, respectively.
We also know that the time derivative of a

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.809
rotation matrix can be expressed in terms
of a skew-symmetric matrix which is a function

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.809
of angular velocity and the rotation matrix
itself. I can rearrange this rather complex

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.799
expression and so for the skew-symmetric matrix,
s. And then, I can equate the finite elements

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.299
of s between the left and right hand side
of my equation.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.780
The result is a relationship between angular
velocity, omega, and the rates of change of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.820
my roll, pitch and yaw angles. And, this relationship
is in terms of yet another Jacobian matrix.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.490
It’s a 3 x 3 Jacobian matrix and is denoted
by the symbol capital B. B is a function of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.810
the roll, pitch, yaw angles. And, more precisely,
it’s a function of the roll angle and the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.670
pitch angle. The yaw angle does not appear
in the expression for this Jacobian matrix.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.229
This is a nice relationship because it links
a very obscure and abstract quantity like

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.130
angular velocity and expresses it in terms
of roll, pitch and yaw rates which are much

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
more intuitive for engineers.
Here is the expression that we introduced

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.860
earlier which maps the rate of change of robot
joint angles to the robot end effector spatial

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.140
velocity. The spatial velocity, as we know,
comprises two components: the translational

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.489
component and a rotational component expressed
here as an angular velocity vector.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.410
What we'd like to do is to redefine this spatial
velocity vector so that the rotational part

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.810
now contains the roll, pitch and yaw rates
of change. If we are going to do that, then

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.739
we need to change our definition of the Jacobian
matrix itself. So, we introduce a variant

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.540
of the Jacobian matrix called JA and that
is the analytic Jacobian matrix and it relates

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.609
the change in robot joint angles to spatial
velocity defined now with roll, pitch and

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.260
yaw angle rates.
To obtain the analytic Jacobian, we start

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.879
with the standard robot manipulator Jacobian
matrix and we pre-multiply it by this matrix,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:57.519
contains a lot of 1s and 0s and it also contains
the inverse of the 3 x 3 Jacobian matrix B.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.890
B is a function of the roll, pitch, yaw angles
which I denote by the symbol capital Gamma.
