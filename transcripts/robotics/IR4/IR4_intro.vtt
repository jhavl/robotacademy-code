00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.370
In the last couple of lectures we've talked
about describing the position and the orientation

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.139
of objects in the world.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.040
We started off talking about position and
orientation in two-dimensional space, that's

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.680
the easiest example to start with, and then
we talked about position and orientation in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
three-dimensional space. This combination
of position; where something is, and orientation;

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
that's how its oriented in space, combined
together we call that the pose of an object,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.350
and pose is really really important in robotics.
So we talk about how we can describe the pose

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.040
of a robot somewhere. For instance, on the
tableâ€”that's a two dimensional example.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.269
Or how we describe the pose of an object in
three-dimensional space.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:55.009
Now while pose is really very useful we also want to talk about how pose changes as a function of time.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.239
Consider the problem with the robot moving
from here to there. It's going to have to

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.000
follow some kind of path, so its pose will
change as a function of time and that leads

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.400
to two very important concepts that we refer
to as a path and a trajectory. And what we

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.400
want to be able to do is to describe how the pose changes smoothly and elegantly as a function of time.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.749
So here for instance is a small example how
the pose of an object can vary as a function

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.009
of time. And we see here in this three-dimensional
co-ordinate frame, its position is changing

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.869
and its orientation is changing very very
smoothly. And we want to be able to apply

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.810
these kinds of techniques to general problems
in robotics.
