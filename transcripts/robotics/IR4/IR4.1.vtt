00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.980
We all have a pretty intuitive idea of what
a path is.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.610
We consider it as a way of getting from place
A to place B.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.400
We can consider it as a set of points that
link A to B; a set of small steps that we

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.960
take along the way.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.679
A path is a spatial construct.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.829
It says something about how we get from A
to B through the world but it doesn't say

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.400
anything about how quickly we should move
along it.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.230
There's no notion of time.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.590
A trajectory on the other hand comprises a
path and a schedule for getting from A to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.520
B. So there is a notion of time or speed along
the path.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.750
It's a set of points that I need to be at
by a particular time.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.530
In my MATLAB work space, I have got two poses
represented as 4x4 homogeneous transformation

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.809
matrices.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.829
The first pose represented by the workspace
variable T0, has got no rotation and has its

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.989
origin at the origin of the world coordinate
frame.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.520
The second post represented by the work space
variable T1, comprises set of 1 in the x direction

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.250
2 in the y direction and 3 in the z direction
and an orientation described by roll pitch

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.840
yaw angles 0.6, 0.8 and 1.4 radians respectively.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.210
And we can visualize each of these poses.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.880
I can plot the pose T0 and we can see there
its origin is at the origin of the world

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880
frame.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.000
And its axes are aligned with the world frame.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.690
I can plot the other pose T1 and we can see
that its origin is not at the origin of the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.100
world reference frame and its axes are not
parallel to the reference axes.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.939
Now I can animate the motion that goes from
pose T0 to pose T1 and we can see our coordinate

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.990
frame is translating and rotating in order
to move from pose T0 to pose T1. So this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.259
is what I mean when I talked about a trajectory
which is smooth motion from one pose to the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.259
next.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.900
Figuring out how to do this is the subject
of this lecture.
