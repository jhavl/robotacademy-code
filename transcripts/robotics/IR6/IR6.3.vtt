00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.189
Now I'm going to add a second joint to the
robot that I've shown you before and this

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.740
robot is a little bit interesting in that
the end effector can reach any particular

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.529
point within an outer maximum circle described
by this, like an easily adaptive position

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.819
like this, like an adaptive position like
that. My two-degree of freedom robot can adapt

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:34.720
any x-y coordinate within the maximum circle.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.070
With this two-degree of freedom robot, although
we can adapt any x-y coordinate within its

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.710
working space, it can’t adapt an arbitrary
orientation. So if the robot wants to be at

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.210
this particular xy coordinate, there is no
other orientation of this link of the robot

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.940
that's possible because orientation and position
are highly coupled.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.370
Let's follow a similar procedure to determine
the pose of the end effector of these two-link

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.890
robot. I'm going to notate the robot and indicate
the length of its two links and indicate the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.630
two joint angles. Next, we're going to rotate
out well coordinate frame by an amount Q1.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.039
So a world reference frame now becomes this
grey coordinate frame shown here. Next I'm

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.600
going to translate that coordinate frame along
with the first link of the robot so now it's

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.350
here. We've applied now a transformation in
the x direction by the distance A1. Now I'm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.899
going to rotate the frame by the amount Q2,
the coordinate frame now looks like this.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.350
Finally, I'm going to translate it in the
x direction by the amount A2. This gives us

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.179
the coordinate frame attached to the end effector
of the robot, the end effector pose.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.060
Now I can expand out this expression and multiply
together each of these matrices and the result

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.759
is this. Once again, we can look at the translational
path of this homogeneous transformation matrix.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.860
These elements here pulling out, and now I
have an expression for the x and y coordinate

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.580
of the end effector of my two-link robot.
Once again we can see that the rotational

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.070
path of this transformation matrix which indicates
the orientation of the end effector is also

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.700
a function of Q1 and Q2. In fact it’s a
function of Q1+Q2. So once again, we can use

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.170
Q1 and Q2 to independently control x and y
but we can't independently control the orientation

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.410
of the end effector. If we use Q1 and Q2 to
choose x and y, then the orientation of the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.030
end-effector is already determined and can
be independently chosen.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.540
An interesting thing with a two-link manipulator
is that there are two joint angle configurations

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.100
that will put the end effector at a desired
position. Here is one configuration of the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.980
robot, and here is an alternative configuration
of the robot that results in the same end

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.240
effector position.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.530
For the two-link robot, I've already created
some works based variables to represent the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.710
link lengths, that's the variables A1 and
A2 and to represent the two joint angles Q1

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.160
and Q2. And you can see their numeric values
over here. To determine the end effector pose

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.610
I need to chain together a number of elementary
homogeneous transformations so I am going

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.290
to have a rotation by Q1 followed by translation
and the x direction by A1 followed by a rotation

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.760
of Q2, followed by a translation in the x
direction by the length of link 2.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.040
And I'm going to pass in the two joint angles,
Q1 and Q2. Here we have a homogeneous transformation

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.900
representing the pose of the end effector
of a two-link robot and the position of the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.520
end effector is given by these two numbers
here and this 2X2 matrix here represents the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.900
orientation of the end effector.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.750
Now we can substitute these numeric values
by symbols so I defined symbol Q1 and Q2 and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.380
symbols for A1 and A2. We can see in the workspace
now these things are symbolic objects as far

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.350
as MATLAB is concerned. And I can repeat this
trchain2 function and what I have now is a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.250
symbolic representation of the pose of this
two-link robot manipulator.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.150
I can import a model of a two-link manipulator
as the tool box of function mdl_planar2, and

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.330
creates a new object in the works based called
P2 which represents this robot manipulator.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.980
What I can do is I can invoke the teach method
again and here we see a two-link robot manipulator

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.550
and I can adjust its joint angles and see
how it moves. Up here we have the x and y

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.150
coordinates of the robot end effector and
we see that that updates as I adjust the joint angles.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.040
An interesting thing with the two-link manipulator
is that there are two sets of joint angles

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.900
which result in the same end effector position.
I'm going to use the plot method and I'm going

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.560
to move the robot to a configuration where
joint one has got an angle of zero and joint

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.860
2 has an angle of pi on two radians.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.860
And here we see a robot in that particular
configuration. Now I'm going to plot it in

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.030
a different configuration, that angle is going
to be pi on two and this angle is going to

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.660
be minus pi on two.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.160
What we see is that the robot end effector
has got exactly the same position. Robot has

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.389
a different configuration, the end effector
has got a different orientation but the position

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.759
is exactly the same.
