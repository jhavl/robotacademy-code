00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.980
In this lecture we're going to talk about
color. You probably notice that I studiously

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.550
avoided talking about color so far. This lecture
we're going to talk properly about color.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.019
Color is something that's really important
for animals. Almost all animals that see can

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.559
see color to some extent.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.570
And perhaps one reason why color is important,
if you think about our ancestors' foraging

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.719
for food, perhaps it was important to be able
to detect some red fruits against the background

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.010
of a green tree. So in this lecture we're
going to talk about what color is, where it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.039
comes from and how we can deal with color
images in the computer. So far we've been

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.530
dealing with gray scale images. And how we
can write the computer program to determine

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.800
what color some object is.
