00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Image features revisited

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.809
In a much earlier lecture, we talked about
the data mismatch problem. That's the fact

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.440
that a sensor like a camera emits a large
number of pixels, perhaps 1 million pixels

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.020
in every image and it's going to be anything
from 10 to 50 images per second that is an

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.890
enormous amount of data.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.550
A machine like a robot requires relatively
little information in order to tell it where

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.110
to go an arm type manipulator like shown here
requires simply 6 numbers which described

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.730
the angles of the joints of the robot.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.710
A mobile robot like the vacuum cleaner shows
here really only requires 2 numbers to control

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.760
its motion, that's its forward velocity V
and its rotational velocity omega.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.620
So, we have the problem with a huge amount
of data coming from a camera sensor, relatively

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.350
little data required by the robot. The way
we get around that then is to extract what

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.579
we call features from the image and we've
talked a bit in previous lectures about region

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.390
features. We've talked about how we can take
an import image. We can find regions which

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.340
are sets of pixels with either similar intensity
or with similar color and we can then describe

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.670
those regions in terms of their centroid,
their bounding box, momentâ€™s perimeter,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.250
circularity and so on.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.619
We've talked a lot about regions but there
are number of other types of features that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.700
are really useful and interesting and that
I'd like to talk a little bit about.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.270
Most real world scenes contain a lot of lines.
This particular picture of a church, I've

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.140
highlighted a number of lines. Some of these
lines come from the contrast between the roof

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.000
and the sky, between the roof and the wall,
the edges of windows, the edges of doors and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.799
so on. Certainly, in any man-made environment,
there are enormous number of lines but even

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.820
in many natural environments there are lines
as well, perhaps the vertical edges of tree

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.070
trunks and so on.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.369
So, lines are very prevalent in the environment
and lines are very simple and compact to describe.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.290
A line might contain a large number of pixels
but is really described by just 2 parameters,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.020
its intercept and its slope.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.080
Now, an interesting question then is: How
do we extract lines in an image, the important,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.319
the dominant lines within an image?

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.190
Another class of features what we call point
features and what's overlaid on this picture

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.930
of a building here are points in the image
that are interesting, that is they describe

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.459
points that are quite distinctive and if I
took another picture of this building, I'd

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.459
have a pretty good chance of finding those same points in a different view of the same building.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.040
So, if I'd move my camera, if the sun's come
out, the sun's going behind the cloud, I would

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.750
still be able to locate these points. The
overlaid graphical information entails a lot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.950
about these feature points. The center of
the circle indicates the center of this distinctive

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.959
pattern that is a pattern that we are very
likely to be able to find in another view

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.530
of the same scene.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.830
The size of the circle indicates something
about the scale of the pattern. Is it a very

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.239
small distinct pattern or a large distinct
pattern? The radio lines say something about

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.379
the orientation of that pattern.
