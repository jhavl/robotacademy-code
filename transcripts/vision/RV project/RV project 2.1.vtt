Welcome to week two in the robotic vision
project. The objective for this week is to

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.550
capture an image of our Robot Vision worksheet
and get it into MATLAB.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.059
The choice is really up to you whether or
not you want to use a local camera, such as

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.170
a compact camera or a mobile phone camera
or you could use a web camera if you like.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.340
I've already written a function in MATLAB
that allows me to do this, so let's go into

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.240
MATLAB now and take a look at what this looks
like in the MATLAB workspace.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.980
Okay so I've taken a photo of the Robotic
Vision worksheet using my mobile phone camera,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.860
I've saved it onto this computer and I named
the image RV.JPEG.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.320
So how we actually get this image into the
MATLAB work space? So currently it's just

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.789
a file, so how do we actually access the image?
Well the robotics toolbox has a function called

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.170
"iread" so we're going to use that function
to load in the image.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.469
So we'll create a variable called img, call
our iread function and we can just simply

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.280
supply the file name that we want to read
in. Again as you can see on the right, we've

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.320
created a new variable called img, these are the pixel dimensions of the image and it has three channels.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.860
Any time you read in an image, it's always
a good idea to actually visualize it, just

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.900
to make sure that nothing funny has happened
and the robotic vision toolbox has another

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.710
function called idisp, which allows you to
actually visualize the image and see what's

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.840
come into the MATLAB work space.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.680
So as you can see here, this is out Robotic
Vision worksheet. Now when you guys take a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.930
photo of your worksheet, there is just three
things that you should keep in mind; the first

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.750
thing is that make sure that all of the shapes
are actually visible, so donâ€™t, you know,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.009
only photograph half of the worksheet and
make sure it's not too far away. Just make

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.430
sure that the worksheet comprises the majority
of the image. That way it's easy for you to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.420
identify the 2D objects later on in the project.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.709
The next thing is that when you take the photo,
just make sure that you're not, you take it

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.890
with a steady hand. So that will reduce any
blurring because we're trying to find and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.920
identify the 2D objects, any blurring will
make that process a lot more difficult. And

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.220
finally because the 2D objects are colorized,
we're relying on colour segmentation, so there

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.760
must be an appropriate amount of illumination
when you take your photo, so just make sure

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.349
that you can actually distinguish between
the different colours, so you have enough

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.649
level of light, such that is possible.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.940
So if you follow those three tips and you
get something that looks something like this,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.540
then you're all good to go onto the next part of the project.
