00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.459
We have just seen how we can load images from
files stored on our computer into the MATLAB

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:13.910
environment where we can begin to look at
them and manipulate them, but for a robot

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.930
it is really important that it is sensing
the world as it is now. So information that

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.900
is stored in a file may not be sufficiently
up to date. We need to see the world as it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.160
is now: we need to be able to bring images
in from a camera.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.220
Now it is really fortunate today that almost
all computers have one or more cameras attached

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.809
to them. So what we are going to look at now
is how we get information from a camera on

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.050
my computer into the MATLAB environment.
So here we are in the MATLAB desktop workspace

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.480
again and in order to grab an image from a
camera we first create an object, a MATLAB

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.469
object that is attached to the camera and
in this case, it is the zeroth cameraâ€”that

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.339
is the first camera that my computer has.
And it creates a new object in the MATLAB

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.521
workspace, an object of type VideoCamera.
As soon as this object has been created, the

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:13.580
camera attached to my computer has become
live; a little red recording light has come

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.380
on. This object supports a number of methods,
and the most important method for our purposes

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.831
is the grab method, which grabs an image from
the camera, the most recent image from the

00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:28.400
camera, and displays it.
We might be interested in actually putting

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.850
the image into a workspace variable and we
do it in this way. We assign the output of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.040
the grab method to a workspace variable and
in this case, the variable im, and the image

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.080
is grabbed from the camera and placed into
that workspace variable. If I call the function

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.979
again it will take another picture and display
it with my head in a different pose.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.229
The camera is running continuously. In order
to turn the camera off I need to destroy the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.560
camera object. You do that with a MATLAB clear
command, so if I clear the object from the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.389
workspace the object is destroyed and the
camera is turned off. The red light disappears.
