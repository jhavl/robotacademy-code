00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.380
Welcome to the very first lecture in our online
course, Introduction to Robotics.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.560
My name is Peter Corke and I’ll be your
lecturer for the next six weeks.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.599
So, this is a really quick run through if
you like the, the fictional underpinnings

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.890
of robotics. What we’re going do in this
first course is look at the great variety

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.660
of robots that exist today. We’re going
start off with manufacturing robots. These

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.870
are the arm type robots that you see working
in factories building cars, building computers

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.829
and so on, very, very important class of robots.
And, that’s the type of robot we are going

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.180
to study most carefully in this Introduction
to Robotics course. But, in this particular

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.600
lecture, I want to paint the big picture of
the different types of robots that are in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.309
the world today. So, we are going to look
at robots that drive, robots that fly, robots

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.070
that swim underneath the water or robots that
paddle around on the surface of the water,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.400
effectively robotic boats.
So, in this first lecture, we are going to

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.180
orient ourselves in learning about the big
spread of robotics. And then, for the remainder

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.909
of the course, we are going to knuckle down
and look at arm type robots in particular.
