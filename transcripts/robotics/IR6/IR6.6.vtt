00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.960
Most real world robots like industrial robots
shown here have got 6 joints.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.639
And typically for industrial robots, those
links are all revolute.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.379
That means they are rotating joints.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.310
Not sliding joints such as we saw earlier
with the stand foot arm.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.920
These robots are also all serial link manipulators
and that means that we get from the base to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.720
the end effector by a series of robot links
and robot joints.
