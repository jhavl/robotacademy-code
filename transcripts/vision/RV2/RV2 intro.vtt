00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.340
In this lecture we're going to learn about
how we get a digital image into a computer.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.869
For robotic vision, this is the essential
first step; we have to have the visual information

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.750
inside the computer, so that we can manipulate
it and eventually extract meaning from it,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.810
so this is the essential first step.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.930
Digital images today are really common, they're
everywhere. Through billions and billions

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.730
of images on Facebook and Flickr and shared
through applications like Instagram. There

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.039
are a few reasons why digital images are so
common today.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.770
The first is that cameras are everywhere so
the opportunities to take pictures are enormous.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.829
We have cameras in our phones, in our tablet
computers, in our laptops. A large number

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.550
of people are now starting to wear cameras
on their heads photographing everything that

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.010
they're seeing and experiencing, 24 by 7 perhaps.
The second reason why is that storage has

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.670
become so cheap. Low cost flash memory in
our phones and in our laptop computers and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.330
terabytes of hard disk storage that you can
buy for relatively little money today. It

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.280
wasn't always this way. Ten years ago we were
making the transition from chemistry to digital

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.439
technology for picture taking.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.990
In the bad old days of chemical imaging, we
had to expose a number of frames on our film;

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.530
we could never delete an image. Once the film
was full, we'd take it to the shop, we'd get

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.399
it developed and we'd get our pictures back
on paper. It was way less flexible. So what

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.320
we're going to do in this lecture is work
out and discuss how we get images from many,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.049
many digital sources, images from perhaps
your photo library, perhaps from the web camera

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.049
on your computer, perhaps from the web and
getting those images into an environment where

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.909
we can begin to manipulate them.
