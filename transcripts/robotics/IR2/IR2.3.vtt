00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
Let's have a look at a slightly more realistic example.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Here I have a 2-dimensional car and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
a 2-dimensional coordinate frame. I've labeled
this coordinate frame W and that stands for

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.589
the world coordinate frame and this is quite
a common thing in robotics to have one reference

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:27.230
frame that all other reference frames are
described with respect to. And to indicate

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.260
that very, very clearly, I've labeled the
x and y axis with the subscript W, so it's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.170
very, very clear that this is the x-axis of
the W frame and the y-axis of the W frame.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.309
Now let's indicate some points of interest
in this car, the left seat: the right seat,

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.210
one of the mirrors, door handles, and perhaps
where we refuel it. I can describe each of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.489
these points by a vector, with respect to
the world coordinate frame.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.730
Now let's imagine that a car has moved, now
it's over here, I could now describe all these

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.900
points again in terms of vectors with respect
to the origin of the world coordinate frame.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.790
But it's a little bit tedious because the
points haven't actually moved with respect

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.580
to the car, the whole car has moved and now
I have to redefine all the vectors again.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.160
Perhaps, there's a better way. And there it
is, we are going to use the coordinate frame

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.120
idea again and we are going to create a new
coordinate frame and I'm going to attach it

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.120
to the car. I labeled this frame C - C for
car. And just to be clear, I labeled the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.110
axis XC and YC: X and Y axis are the coordinate
frame that are attached to the car. Now it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.710
a simple matter to describe all these points
of interest on the car in terms of vectors

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.030
with respect to the car's coordinate frame.
Now if I moved the car, the vectors have changed

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.270
with respect to the world but they haven't
changed with respect to the car's coordinate frame.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.930
Let's simplify things a bit and introduce
a pose here. So introduce another one of these

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
fat arrows which represents a pose, and this
is the pose from the world coordinate frame

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.410
to the car's coordinate frame so it's W ksi Z.
Now let's look at just a single point, one

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.690
of the points on the door of the car. I'm
going to label that point d and we created

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.560
vector from frame C to this point d, and we
denote that in the way we've already discussed

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.020
we use a symbol P to denote that we're talking
about a vector. C is the reference frame so

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.850
this is a vector with respect to frame C,
so it begins at the origin of frame C and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.610
it goes to the point d. Now let's consider
that I want to know what is this vector: the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.830
point D with respect to the world coordinate
frame. In some sort of simplistic way, what

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.100
I want to do is to add these 2 arrows. I want
to move along here, and I want to move along

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.370
here. But it's not quite that simple, we can't
add a pose and a vector. We can't add a fat

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.990
arrow to a thin arrow. Poses and vectors are
different mathematical objects so we need

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.030
to do this a little bit carefully.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.900
The way we do it is to introduce a new operator,
and it's the dot. In this formalism, we have

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.600
a pose and it operates on a vector in order
to transform it to a different coordinate

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.180
frame. That's what this operator dot does:
it transforms this vector which describes

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.110
the point d with respect to the coordinate
frame C, to a vector that describes the point

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.709
d with respect to the coordinate frame W.
It performs a transformation between coordinate

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.819
frames. All of this is rather abstract. Iâ€™ve
introduced this operator dot, but I haven't

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.130
told you actually what it is - how would you
code it? And, we introduced this abstract

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.170
pose thing described by the Greek letter ksi
- and I haven't said exactly what that is

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.830
or how you could code that or implement that.
These are things would get to in the following

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.370
sections in this lecture.
