00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.670
Let’s look in a bit more detail at food,
a fundamental requirement for human life.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.320
The United Nations predicts that by the year
2050, we will need a 70% increase in food

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.240
production. Not all of this is due to increase
population. A lot of it is due to the requirements

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.039
of many of the people on our planet to have
more food than they’re currently getting

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.869
and perhaps higher quality food, higher calorific
value food. So, a big requirement to increase

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.710
food production and 70% is a massive increase
to be achieved in something like 30 years.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.739
It’s pretty obvious that we need food for
people to eat. We also need food for animals

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.210
to eat. They are part of our food chain. So,
a lot of the food that we produce is eaten

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.800
by animals and in turn, many of us eat those
animals.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.910
A somewhat surprising use for food is putting
it in cars. There’s quite a movement to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.719
turn food product, particularly corn into
ethanol and we put the ethanol into the gas

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.550
tanks of our cars. So, there’s a lot of
competition for the food that we produce.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.390
Absolutely, we want food for people to eat
but there’s also food that’s required

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.299
to feed animals and there’s also food that’s
required to feed cars.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.860
As our population grows, so too does the size
of our cities. The cities get larger; they

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.960
encroach on productive farmland. They take
that land out of food production because we

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.130
build houses and apartments on it, so that
means we have less land on which to grow food.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.470
Now, this is a problem because overall we
need to grow more food and we’re removing

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.810
land which is the essential resource when
it comes to food production.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.100
Another issue is that farmers as a population
are getting older. This statistic is from

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.719
my country, Australia, and we look at this
histogram here and it shows that the average

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.740
age of farmers is well above 50. There's not
young people moving into farming as a profession

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.860
or as a lifestyle. A very scary statistic
in my country, Australia, is that in the next

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.340
decade, half of the farmers are going to retire.
So, who’s going to do the work on the land

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.310
to produce the food that we need?

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.670
So, one of the opportunities for robotics
is to help and solve this food production

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.990
problem. One application is to convert these
large machines which are used in industrial

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.830
scale food production. Instead of having a
human being on board the machine driving it,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.580
we turn it into a robotic vehicle so it can
drive all by itself, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.500
Another thing we can do is to replace human-driven
machines which are used to spray crops in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.800
the field and we spray the crops to eliminate
insect and weed pests. Rather than doing indiscriminate

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.390
spraying as you see here, we can have much
more intelligent, robotic systems which move

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.270
perhaps more slowly through the crop and use
vision sensors which identify insects pests

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.670
or undesirable plants which we call weeds
and apply the appropriate chemical to just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.050
where that occurrence is, not indiscriminately,
not everywhere. That’s got huge environmental

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.150
benefits and it’s also got huge cost benefits
because we can reduce the amount of chemical

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.390
that needs to be applied.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.040
The use of chemical herbicides to control
weeds has led to an unexpected outcome and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.810
that is that many weed species have now evolved
a resistance to these standard herbicides.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.940
That presents a particular challenge to an
agricultural system which has developed over

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.040
decades and become incredibly reliant on the
use of herbicides for weed control. So, perhaps

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.970
smart robots could identify weeds in the soil
and destroy them mechanically as shown here,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.620
actually disturb the soil around the weed
to destroy the weed.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.630
Here’s a video of a robot we’ve developed
in a research project in my lab here at QUT.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.270
This is an early prototype of our weed spraying
robot. It’s a very small machine. It’s

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.720
guided by cameras and other sorts of sensors.
It can navigate along crop rows and apply

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.000
herbicide only where it’s required.
