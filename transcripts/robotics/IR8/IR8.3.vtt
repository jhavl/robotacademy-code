00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.630
This is the linear relationship between joint
angle velocity and end effector velocity that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.500
we worked out a moment ago. The Jacobian matrix
here J is a two by two matrix and that means

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.610
that it's very easy to invert, so we can write
the expression like this. And what this is

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.370
saying is if I know the end effector velocity
that I want, and if I can compute the Jacobian

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.300
matrix and then invert it, I can work out
what joint angle velocities I need in order

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.000
to achieve this particular end effector velocity
and this is a very powerful thing. No matter

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.690
what the end effector velocity is, I can always
work out a set of joint angle velocities that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.120
will give me that end effector velocity.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.999
We've previously worked out what the Jacobian
matrix is for this simple, two link, planar

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.469
manipulator and because it's only a two by
two matrix, it's very easy to invert and the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.799
inverse looks like this. There's one slightly
problematic aspect of this inverse Jacobian

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.680
and that is this term here, when the second
joint angle, Q2 is equal to zero, this inverse

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.119
Jacobian becomes infinite. That might seem
a little bit unusual but there's a pretty

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.649
simple intuition behind this.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.540
Let's have a look at the robot configuration
where this occurs. So this is what the robot

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.869
looks like when Q2 is equal to zero. And this
particular configuration of the robot is often

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.859
referred to as a singular pose because it
introduces a singularity into the Jacobian

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.950
matrix of the robot. A robot configuration
like this is really exactly the same as a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.149
single link robot that looks like this, so
this is a robot which only a single joint

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.869
angle. And clearly a robot like this has got
very, very limited motion. The end effector

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.409
velocity can only ever be parallel to this
blue vector here. That is tangential to the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.600
axis of the robot's link. It's not possible
for the robot end effector to move in this

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.759
direction at all and this is where the term
singularity comes from. In this particular

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.270
configuration of the robot, it's lost a degree
of freedom. There is a direction in the robot's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.780
Cartesian workspace, in which it is impossible
for the end effector to move.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.930
Even if a joint angle in not exactly equal
to zero; perhaps it's nearly zero, then we

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.310
will still have problems in the directions
that the robot is able to move. So a robot

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.310
in this sort of configuration will find it
difficult to move in this particular direction.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.510
We can compute the determinant of the Jacobian
matrix and if it's equal to zero or if it's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.080
equal to small, that tells you that there
is some motion direction for the robot that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.051
will be difficult or awkward. You can think
about this in terms of your own arm; there

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:53.370
are some configurations of the arm where you
have the ability to move with almost equal

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.902
velocity in many different directions and
there are some other configurations of your

00:02:56.902 --> 00:03:01.560
arm, where it's really only possible to have
velocity in one direction; for instance when

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.140
you're trying to throw a ball, you put your
arm into a configuration where you can have

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.180
maximum velocity in the direction you want
the ball to go, but almost no velocity component

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.780
in direction orthogonal to that.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.010
Another way to describe this situation is
in terms of the condition number of the Jacobian.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.230
The condition number is a scalar that we can
compute from any matrix and if the condition

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.980
number is large it indicates that the matrix
is close to being singular, that is it's determine

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.150
is close to zero. You can consider this problematic
situation of the Jacobian matrix in terms

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.570
of it having either a small determinant or
a large condition number. The condition number

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.819
can be computed in MATLAB using the built
in function "cond()".
