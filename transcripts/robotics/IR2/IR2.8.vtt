00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's summarize some of the big ideas from
this lecture. The first thing that I want

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.160
to say, and I can't say this strongly enough,
is that coordinate frames are your friend.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.800
They make it very easy to decompose and understand
complex problems. So we assign coordinate

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.070
frames to everything in the robot's environment
and write down the relationships between the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.730
coordinate frames. Itâ€™s a very rigorous
approach and will ultimately save you a lot

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.169
of time. Don't be afraid to use lots of coordinate
frames.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.380
Coordinate frames follow the right-handed
convention, the X axis and the Y axis are

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.990
related like this. If we have 2 coordinate
frames the relative rotation between them

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:48.050
is defined like this, angle increases positively
in the anti-clockwise direction. Points can

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.970
be represented as vectors with respect to
particular coordinate frames and in our notation

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.630
we denote a vector by lower case p, and the
preceding label indicates the frame that the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.340
vector is with respect to, and the trailing
label indicates the destination of that vector.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.770
So in this case the A denotes the fact that
the vector starts at the origin of frame A

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.520
and it goes to the point B.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.790
We can describe the relationship between two
coordinate frames in terms of pose. And pose

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.600
is something that has got three parameters:
it's got a translation, the X and Y component

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.900
and the rotation which is the theta component.
We can consider it as a simple motion, a translation

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.220
and a rotation. Graphically we denote pose
by a thick vector with a triangular head.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.940
Symbolically we represent it by the Greek
letter ksi. The left-hand label indicates

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.070
the frame of reference and the right-hand
label indicates the destination pose. So in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.810
this case this is saying this is the relative
pose from coordinate frame A to coordinate frame B.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.860
We can describe a point in terms of vectors
with respect to different coordinate frames.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
In this case the point D, we can describe
with a vector in coordinate frame C attached

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.249
to the car or coordinate frame W which is
fixed within the world. We can transform a

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:19.549
vector from one coordinate frame to another
by applying the dot operator and the pose,

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.359
which describes the relationship between the
two coordinate frames. We can't simply add

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.519
vectors and poses because they are different
mathematical objects.

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.079
We can combine poses. So if we know the pose
from frame A to frame B and the pose from

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:41.109
frame B to frame C then we use the O+ operator
to compose them into the relative pose from

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.299
frame A to frame C, and we can extend this
approach indefinitely. This process is sometimes

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.040
called compounding or composition.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.370
We can rewrite a complex set of spatial relationships
defined in terms of coordinate frames, in

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.249
terms of a bit tidier, a pose graph. And
we can use the pose graph to write spatial

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.790
relationships that describe relative poses
in terms of other relative poses.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.739
We introduced a spatial algebra. The important
things to note are that we can compose or

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.319
compound two relative poses using the O+ operator.
The O+ operator is not commutative so ksi

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.340
1 O+ ksi 2 is not equal to ksi 2 O+ ksi 1.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.319
We have a concept of a null pose that's a
zero relative motion. If we add it or we subtract

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.090
it from a pose it makes no difference, the
original pose is unchanged. And we introduced

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.079
a negation operator, the O- symbol, and that
is equivalent to the inverse motion of X ksi

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:55.919
Y, the motion from frame X to frame Y, the
negation of that is motion from frame Y to frame X.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.379
And we also introduced the dot operator which
transforms a vector from one coordinate frame to another.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.659
These are all very abstract concepts. We've
introduced a lot of symbols, we've introduced

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.459
ksi to represent a pose, O+, O- and the dot.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.849
The next step is to turn this into real mathematical
objects and we can describe rotation in terms

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:26.490
of a 2 x 2 matrix that transforms a vector
from one coordinate frame to another coordinate

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.810
frame if the origins of those two frames are
identical. The 2 x 2 rotation matrix is an

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.500
orthogonal or orthonormal matrix, its inverse
is the same as its transpose and its determinant

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.860
is always +1. We say that such matrices belong
to the special orthogonal group of dimension

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.740
2. The matrix transforms a vector from coordinate
frame B to coordinate frame A, but it is defined

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.169
in terms of the angle from coordinate frame
A to coordinate frame B.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.979
Finally we can describe pose in terms of a
concrete mathematical object and that is a

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:12.800
3 x 3 homogeneous transformation matrix which
belongs to the special Euclidean group of

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.990
dimension 2. The homogeneous transformation
matrix contains the rotation matrix and it

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.699
also contains the translation - that's the
vector from the origin frame A to the origin

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:32.819
of frame B. So this homogeneous transformation
matrix is equivalent to the abstract symbol

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.990
ksi that we've used earlier. Points are described
in terms of vectors, but when we use the homogeneous

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.979
transformation, we describe points in terms
of homogeneous vectors. We take the original

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.770
vector with two elements and we append a one
element to that.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.300
Composition of poses for which we introduce
the abstract O+ operator is performed by matrix

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.530
multiplication. We multiply the two 3 x 3
matrices together to yield a new 3 x 3 matrix.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.389
Negation which we described previously by
the abstract by the O- operator is the inverse

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.669
of the homogeneous transformation matrix,
and remember that the inverse for a homogeneous

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.300
matrix is not equal to its transpose. That
property only belongs to a rotation matrix

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.080
which is just a little part of the homogeneous
transform matrix.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.379
The abstract operator dot which we used to
transform a vector from one coordinate frame

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:38.449
to another is implemented by multiplying the
homogeneous transformation matrix by the homogeneous

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.610
representation of that vector.
