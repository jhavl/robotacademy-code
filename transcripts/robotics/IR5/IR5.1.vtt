00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.899
As we just mentioned, the key elements of
an inertial measurement unit are sensors that

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.950
measure acceleration, magnetic field and angular
velocity. Now, we’re going to talk about

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.140
how we measure acceleration.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.699
What I have in front of me here is what’s
called a quadrotor. It is a flying robot.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.939
It’s got four propellers. And, by controlling
the speed of the individual propellers, I

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.470
can make the machine go up, down, left, right
and so on. Really critically important to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.940
control a machine like this in the air is
a sense of balance knowing its orientation

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.079
in 3D space. So, it has an inertial measurement
unit on board. So, somewhere inside this large

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.010
stack of electronics, there is a board that
looks something like this. This board contains

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.660
three accelerometers, which allow it to determine
its roll and pitch angle in space. It contains

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.789
three gyroscopes which measure its rotational
velocity around three orthogonal axis. And,

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.640
it contains a three-axis magnetometer, so it
can determine its orientation where it’s

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.950
heading with respect to the Earth’s magnetic
field.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.270
Now, this little board is customised for this
particular quadrotor. A commercial product

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.510
that performs exactly the same function is
a device like this. It's got a USB port that plugs

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.010
in to a computer, but internally, it contains
three accelerometers, three gyroscopes, and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.950
three magnetometers. Now, this same functionality
exists in very compact form inside almost

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.290
all modern smartphones. And, this enables
the smartphone compass application so it can

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.170
find north, it can determine roll and pitch
angles. It’s sometimes used for game control and so on.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.240
Imagine now that I’m standing in a lift
or an elevator, and I’ve got a very simple

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.960
dynamical model for my body. It consists
of a mass sitting on a spring. The mass represents

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.130
the mass of my body situated at a point at
my centre mass and it’s sitting on a spring

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.270
which represents the softness of my lower
body and my legs. Now, as the lift starts

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.610
to move upwards, we feel momentarily heavier,
that is the weight pushes down on the spring.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.940
And, as the lift comes to a stop, we feel
momentarily lighter and this is because of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.530
inertial effect. It means that it wants to
maintain its current velocity. So, when we

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.220
start off, it wants to maintain its original
0 velocity and that’s what causes it to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.910
lag behind the person moving up in a lift.
And, that compresses the spring, it make them

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.810
feel heavier.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.420
As the lift slows down, the weight wants to
keep going at the vertical velocity of the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.210
lift and that causes that spring to extend
and causes us to feel a little bit lighter.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.090
Here is a small modern inertial measurement
unit, the type that’s quite commonly used

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.230
in a variety of robot systems. Inside the
little box are a number of sensors including

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.290
accelerometers. So, let’s look inside the
box and see how an accelerometer works. And,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.990
it looks just like the example we studied
before. It contains a mass and a spring. As

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.500
the body of the accelerometer accelerates
upwards, the weight extends the spring. And,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.510
as the accelerometer decelerates, the spring
pulls the weight upwards. So, the extension

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.170
of the spring is linearly related to the acceleration
of the body of the accelerometer. This is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.330
the fundamental principle underpinning all
acceleration sensing devices.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.230
Let’s look inside the box and, once again,
we see a spring and a mass. The mass is often

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.520
referred to as the proof mass. And, in this
example, it’s got a mass of m and the extension

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.740
of the spring is denoted by the symbol x.
Now, I’m going to mark the center of mass

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.800
of the proof mass and its displacement with
respect to the ground, I’m going to denote it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.790
by xm. And, the displacement of the body of
the accelerometer, I’m going to denote by

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.860
the symbol xb. And, so the acceleration of
the body is equal to xb double dot and I can

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.150
write a relationship between xm, xb and x.
The spring force acting on the proof mass,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.459
I’m going to call fs, and the gravity force
acting on the proof mass is the mass multiplied

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.870
by gravitational acceleration g. I can write
Newton’s second law which relates the acceleration

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.009
of the mass to the two forces acting on at the spring force upwards and gravity acting downwards.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.090
And, for a spring, we know that the force is
proportional to the extension of the spring,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.919
and we can imagine that as x increases, I’m
extending the spring and it is pulling upwards

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.930
with a greater and greater force. Now, we
can combine these equations and do a little

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.669
bit of rearrangement and simplification. And
now, I’m able to write an expression that

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.939
relates the extension of the spring, x, to
the acceleration of the body, a, and the gravitational

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:55.249
acceleration, g. It’s really important to
note that it cannot tell the difference between

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:00.889
acceleration of the body, a, or gravitational
acceleration, g, and this is something we’ll

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.680
return to in just a moment.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.279
Every accelerometer has a sensitive direction
and, typically, that’s marked on the body

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.809
of the accelerometer package. Now, in this
particular example, the accelerometer measures

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:18.009
acceleration in the vertical direction, but
it is insensitive to acceleration in the horizontal

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.180
direction or in the direction out of the screen.
If I place an accelerometer at rest somewhere

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.050
on the surface of the Earth, the accelerometer
records an acceleration of 1g in the vertical

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.279
or upward direction and this is a little bit
unintuitive. If I drop something, it’s going

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.949
to accelerate in the downward direction that
the accelerometer measures 1g in the vertical

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.270
or upward direction. And, this is a consequence
of Einstein’s Equivalence Principle.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.680
And, these two examples are exactly the same
as far as an accelerometer is concerned. The

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.249
accelerometer is sitting on the surface of
planet Earth, or if it is sitting in a rocket

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:01.860
which is accelerating upwards at 1g. In both
these cases, the accelerometer will register

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.889
an acceleration of 1g in the vertical direction.
Gravitational acceleration varies across the

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.430
surface of the Earth. The Earth is not a perfect
sphere. It’s slightly squashed, so the diameter

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.460
at the equator is greater than the diameter
measured through the poles. Because of this,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.479
somebody who is standing at the equator is
further away from the center of the Earth.

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.749
So, therefore, they experience a lower gravitational
acceleration. So, we can see quite clearly

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:34.680
in this figure here, the gravitational acceleration
in the equatorial band is significantly lower

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.839
than gravitational acceleration in the temperate
and Polar Regions of the Earth.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:47.520
The standard gravity value is taken as 9.80665
meters per second squared, but note the significant

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.430
variation depending on where you are. The
low cost accelerometers that you have in your

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.139
phone and perhaps in the navigation system
in your car are based on micro-electromechanical

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.509
system technology and the whole device is
etched out of silicon. The inertial mass or

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:08.309
proof mass is supported by flexible spring
legs. In the case of horizontal acceleration,

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:14.110
the inertial mass will move sideways. And,
the change in position is measured capacititively

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.029
using these sensors here. It’s really useful
to be able to measure acceleration in three

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:25.229
orthogonal directions aligned with the x,
y and z-axis of a right-handed coordinate

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:32.319
frame. Today, you can buy tri-axial accelerometers
as a single chip. It contains three MEMS accelerometer

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:38.419
sensors, electronics, analog to digital converters,
filters and a serial IO capability so that

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.369
you can very easily connect it to a microcontroller.

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:47.509
You may not be aware that you have accelerometers
in your head. In the inner ear assembly in

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:52.949
each of our ears, there are a pair of accelerometers.
And, the physical principles underlying these

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:57.339
biological accelerometers are just the same
as those we’ve already been talking about.

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:02.559
The proof mass is a bunch of calcium carbonate
crystals and they are referred to as otoliths,

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:07.559
which means literally ear stones. They are
sitting on a gelatinous membrane which serves

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:12.319
as the spring. And, embedded in that gelatinous
membrane are a bunch of hair cells and they

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:17.589
measure the displacement of the otoliths with
respect to the inner ear. We have two of these

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:21.349
accelerometers in each ear, one is called
the utricle and one is called the saccule.

00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:25.960
And, they are oriented almost orthogonally,
so one senses the acceleration in the horizontal

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.789
direction, and one senses the acceleration
in the vertical direction.

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:34.680
As you change the orientation of your head,
the acceleration signals from the utricle

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.589
and the saccule vary and allows your brain
to determine something about the orientation

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:43.190
of your head with respect to the world coordinate
frame.
