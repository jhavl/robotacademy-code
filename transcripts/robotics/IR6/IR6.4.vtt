00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.649
Now we are going to add a third link to my
robot.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.549
So now, we have a 3-degree of freedom robot
with 3 revolute or 3 rotational joints.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.960
This robot has a much larger working volume.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.590
It can reach any point within this very large
circle here, but because it has got 3 degrees

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.070
of freedom it means it cannot only reach any
particular position within its work space.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.400
It can also achieve any orientation at that
particular position.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.090
If for example the robot's end effector position
is here, then the robot with 3 degrees of

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.340
freedom is able to achieve any arbitrate orientation
of this last link of the robot.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.440
We could see I can move it through quite a
large range of angles of that link and it

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.989
is possible because it has 1 extra degree
of freedom.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.530
Let us determine the pose of the end effector
of our 3-link robot.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.680
The first thing we are going to do is to annotate
the robot and introduce the lengths of the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.970
various links and then we are going to introduce
the various joint angles.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.500
Q1 and Q2 in this diagram are both positive
and Q3 here is a negative value.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.659
You note that the direction of rotation is
the opposite of that for Q1 and Q2.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.780
When we did this for the 1 and 2 joint robots,
I showed an animation of the coordinate frame

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.920
moving from the reference coordinate frame
along the links and ending up at the end effector.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.189
I am not going to do that animation this time.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.630
I think you got the general idea and what
we are going to do is just write down the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.340
transform expression by inspection.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.950
The 1st thing we are going to do is to rotate
it at Q1, translate in the X-direction by

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.170
A1, rotate by the angle Q2, translate along
the 2nd link in its X-direction by the amount

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.130
of A2 and then rotate by the angle Q3 and
then translate in the X-direction by an amount

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.130
A3.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.709
Once again, I can expand out what these matrices
and multiply them together to come up with

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.530
a homogenous transformation which represents
the pose of the end effector of this 3-joint

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.530
robot.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.670
To do this by hand for the 3-link robot is
a little bit tedious.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.670
I might make an error.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.340
So we are going to go straight to MATLAB and
do it there.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.049
Now, we are going to use the MATLAB to compute
the pose of the end effector of this 3-link

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.049
planar robot.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.599
We are going to do it just in symbolic form
this time.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.230
I create some symbols to represent the 3 links
lengths: A1, A2 and A3 and they represent

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.110
the 3 joint angles: Q1, Q2 and Q3.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.519
Once again, we used the trchain2 to function
and the string now I pass in describes the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.209
way the coordinate frame moves from the base
of the robot to the tip.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.030
So I am going to do a rotation by the angle
Q1, translation by the distance A1, a rotation

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.560
by angle Q2, translation in the X-direction
by the distance A2, another rotation this

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.909
one by the angle Q3 and another translation
by the distance A3 that is moving along the

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.370
3rd link of the robot.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.121
Now, I am going to pass the end effector of
the joint angles Q1, Q2 and Q3 and here, we

00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:16.930
have a symbolic expression which represents
the pose of the end effector of this 3-link

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.930
robot.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.880
You see this is now quite a complex expression
as we need to scroll sideways to see the end

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.329
of it.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.209
The x component for example is given by the
1st row and the 3rd column of the result that

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.239
I just computed and that is the expression
for the X-coordinate of the end effector of

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.110
the 3-link robot.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.650
I can also import a model of a planar 3-link
robot and that is the tool box function and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.739
the planar tree creates a serial link object
in our workspace.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.519
The variable is called P3 and there is some
methods that I can apply to this object and

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.239
the teach method that we have looked at previously.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.040
I can do it on this 3-link robot and here
it is.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.360
I can increase joint angle number 1.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.879
I can decrease joint angle number 2.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.590
I can increase joint angle number 3 and we
can see it moving and we can see the position

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.050
of the end effector changing as I adjust these
sliders.
