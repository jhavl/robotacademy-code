00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.230
We all have tens of thousands of images stored
in our computer in this day and age.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.309
Here’re some images from my own personal
collection, the ones that I took on a holiday

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.520
to the northern part of Australia a few years
ago. There are pictures of water lilies, birds,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.840
trees, sunsets, Aboriginal rock art, and crocodiles.
Every image in this collection is stored in

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.699
an individual file in the file system of my
computer. Let’s select this particular crocodile

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.390
image here and we can see which file it is
in. This is a Mac, so I come up here and I

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.110
will look at the file in the Mac’s file
browser utility called Finder. Under Linux,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.600
Windows, there are equivalent applications.
And here we can see the particular file that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.239
holds that crocodile image. We can see that
it has a .JPG extension, that means it is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.810
a JPEG image and we will talk about what that
means shortly, and we can see that it is 3.7

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.629
megabytes long.
Now we can open that image in the regular

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.180
image browser on the Mac, and in this case
it is the application called Preview. There

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.110
we see the crocodile looming large on the
screen. And we can zoom into this image and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.110
as we zoom in we see that the image becomes
more and more block-like. And as we zoom right

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.560
in we can see that the image is made up of
these tiny little blocks. These are the smallest

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.939
elements within the picture. We call them
pixels, that’s short for picture elements.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.229
So what you are seeing here are individual
pixels that comprise this particular image.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.780
Let’s go back to where we were.
For each particular image, as well as the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.689
data that comprises the image itself, the
pixels that make up the picture, there is

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.979
a bunch of additional information which is
referred to as metadata. And we can look at

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.700
the metadata for this image by clicking this
button here. Now, the metadata is displayed

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.040
up in the top corner, and there is quite a
bit of it. First of all, we can see the model

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.729
number of the camera that took these pictures.
We can see the resolution of the image and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.430
that is that the image is 3248 pixels wide
by 2160 pixels tall. We can see that the image

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.129
is 3.7 megabytes long on the disk. We can
see the focal length or the zoom setting that

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.510
I used when I took this particular picture.
I can see the F-stop or aperture setting.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.239
And I can also see the exposure time or shutter
time when I took this particular picture.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.449
More modern cameras would have additional
metadata, for things like the GPS coordinate

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:44.879
of the place where the image was captured.
There are many, many different types of image

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.059
format commonly used today. If you go and
look on Wikipedia, you can find that there

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:54.879
are hundreds of different types of image file
format. I have listed here just a few of the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.239
most common ones. JPEG are format files which
typically have a file extension of .jpg or

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:10.269
.jpeg. TIFF files, GIF files, Portable network
graphics or PNG files, and many others. When

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.199
we actually look inside an image file, it
has really three separate components, and

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:22.540
they live within what we call a container.
So here we have an empty container. And one

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.090
of the first elements in the container is
what is called the header, and the header

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.359
contains information about how big the image
is, how wide it is, how tall it is and the

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.749
type of compression, and the type of pixel
format. Is it eight bits per pixel, ten bits

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:41.359
per pixel or whatever.
The next object in the container is what is

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.050
called the metadata, and that has information
about the actual picture that was taken. It

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.150
might have the GPS coordinate of the camera
when the picture was taken. It might have

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.069
the F number and the focal length, and whether
the flash fired or not. So it is information

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.750
about that particular picture that was taken.
And then, finally we have the actual pixel

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.409
data itself, the information which represents
the image and it may be compressed or not

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.010
compressed.
So when we talk about image file format, we

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.030
need to actually talk about two things. We
need to talk about the particular container

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.949
that holds this information and there are
different types of containers. And we also

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.810
need to talk about the different compression
methods which are applied to the image pixel

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.720
data.
So when we commonly talk about a JPEG file,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.139
JPEG format file, correctly we should be saying
that this is an EXIF container that holds

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.749
JPEG compressed image data.
