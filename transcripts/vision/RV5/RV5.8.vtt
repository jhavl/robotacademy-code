00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.140
Let’s summarise what we’ve learned.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.019
The camera is a really wonderful sensor for
a robot to have, but it produces an unusable

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.259
torrent of data.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.339
There are just too many pixels.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.470
Far more pixels than a robot can action.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.370
So what we need to do is to simplify this
stream of data and to find meaningful objects

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.770
within that stream of data that a robot can
respond to, move to, whatever.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.050
So a region is a set of adjacent pixels with
a similar intensity or colour.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.290
We’ve talked about techniques to find regions
within a scene.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.000
We’ve use a technique called region labelling
to distinguish multiple distinct objects that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.940
exist within a single binary image.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.920
Once we have labelled regions, then we can
extract features to describe each of those

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.920
regions.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.160
We have multiple regions within the scene,
and for each of them we can determine the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.750
position of the region, the size of the region,
the shape of the region, and its orientation.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.930
We’ve talked about techniques to measure
and estimate all of these things, and demonstrated

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.400
how to do a lot of these things using MATLAB
and the MATLAB tool box.
