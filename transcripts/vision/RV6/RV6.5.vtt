00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.590
The first stage in the process is the illuminant;
that is, what creates the light that falls

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.690
on the scene that is ultimately reflected
into our eyes. So where does the light come

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.330
from? Well there are many, many different
sources of light; incandescence’s is emitted

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.850
by hot objects, that could be the white hot
filament of a tungsten light bulb or it could be the sun.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.280
Old fashion cathode ray tubes—as found in
televisions and old computer monitors—generate

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.930
light by firing very energetic electrons at
phosphors and these are chemicals that accept

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.110
that high energy electron and convert that
into photons or light.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.500
We also have light emitting diodes, gas discharge
tubes and lasers.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.830
Way back in 1672, Isaac Newton developed what
he called the spectral theory of light and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.830
he did a very famous experiment, light entered
the room through a hole in a covering over

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.470
the window and entered a prism where he saw
that it was split into many different colors.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.760
And then he was able to show that he could
recombine the multiple colors of light back

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.600
into a single beam of white light.
What you see here is an image of Isaac Newton’s

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.960
notebook that records this experiment that
he did.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.310
A very iconic image is of a beam of white
light entering a prism and being split into

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.020
all of the colors of the rainbow. These different
colors represent light of different frequencies

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.020
and we tend to describe the frequency of a
particular color of light in terms of its

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.380
wavelength. It is a length and it is measured
in units of nanometers; ten to the minus nine

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.229
meters. Now, not all light is visible, human
beings are able to see light between about

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.479
400 nanometers and 700 nanometers. Light with
wavelengths shorter than 400 nanometers we

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.140
refer to as ultra-violet and light with wavelengths
greater than 700 nanometers we refer to as

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.000
infra-red.
Light is an electromagnetic wave and if we

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.639
look at this graphically we see that there
are two

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:18.319
self-reinforcing waves, moving through space
in this direction along the x axis. One of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.739
those waves is an electric field; the other
wave is a magnetic field. The length of a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.939
single cycle of either of these waves we refer
to as the wavelength and very commonly give

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.819
it the symbol lambda.
So the wavelength is the length of a single

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.450
cycle of this electromagnetic wave and for
light it is between 400 and 700 nanometers.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.359
Let’s now consider black body radiators
and the two most common black body sources

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.310
of light that we use are the traditional incandescent
tungsten light bulb, though these are now

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.909
going out of fashion, and the sun. The sun
is a very hot object in the sky that omits

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.959
visible light.
The amount of light that a black body radiator

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.029
omits as a function of its wavelength is given
by this curve here. The visible range of light

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:17.930
is shown here. This curve is described by
Planck’s law and it contains a large number

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.840
of constance, and one of the terms in this
expression is T, that is the temperature of

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.389
the black body radiator. That is the temperature
of the tungsten filament or it is the temperature

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.260
of the surface of the sun.
Typically, these are in the order of thousands

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.819
of degrees kelvin. The curve has got a very
clear peak, and the wavelength of this peak

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.989
is given by the Wien displacement law, and
what this shows is that the wavelength associated

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.519
with the maximum of this peak is inversely
related to the temperature.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.590
So low temperatures have a large lambda associated
with the peak and as the temperature increases

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.299
this lambda acts, decreases. It moves to a
shorter wavelength. And we actually have an

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.730
intuitive feel for this: what I have plotted
here are the black body emission curves for

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.529
black bodies at a range of different temperatures — from 1000 kelvin up to 6000 kelvin — and as we

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:19.120
can see, as the temperature increases, the
wavelength associated with the maximum is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.400
moving towards a smaller wavelength … it
is becoming more blue. So as its temperature

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.050
increases, the wavelength associated with
the maximum emission moves to lower wavelengths,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.740
to bluer colors.
In our language we use colors to describe

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.400
temperatures. Something that is pretty hot,
metal that is just about to begin be able

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.639
to be worked, we describe as being red hot.
As we increase the temperature it becomes

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.009
yellow hot, it is glowing a different color,
it is more yellow now and as the temperature

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.069
goes up it starts to omit white light. And
we refer to that as being white hot.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.080
Let’s have a go at plotting one of these
black body curves. To get started with, just

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.759
to make life a little bit easier for myself
I am going to define a symbol NM, stands for

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.889
nanometer and is equal to one by ten to the
minus nine. Make life a little bit easier.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.360
And I am going to create a vector of wavelengths.
I am going to call it lambda and it is going

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.169
to vary from three hundred nanometers in steps
of ten nanometers all the way up to a thousand

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.990
nanometers, this is going from the near ultra-violet
through into the infra-red part of the spectrum.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.050
Now I can compute a black body radiator emission
curve, using the black body function. I parse

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.780
in the range of wavelengths that I am interested
in and I parse in the temperature. And I am

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.759
going to put in 6500 kelvin, which is the
temperature of the sun. I can plot this curve,

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.259
one axis is going to be lambda and the other
axis is going to be E. And here we have a

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.750
plot of the response of the black body radiator.
I am going to put a grid on there.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.939
Let’s look at the case now for a black body
radiator, but at a lower color temperature

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.900
and I am going to reduce the color temperature
a little bit.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.969
So let’s come back here and I am going to
reduce the color by 500 degrees. Put that

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:17.969
into the variable E. I am going to overlay
that plot and now I am going to plot E against

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.759
lambda and I am going to do it with dashline
so we can see what’s the difference. And

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:30.719
what we can see is that the curve is lower;
this slightly cooler body is emitting less

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:38.330
energy overall. The peak of its omission has
moved from around 450 nanometers to closer

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:46.510
to 480 nanometers. So it has got a little bit cooler and it is a little bit more red in its appearance.
