00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.200
Let’s summarise some of the things we have
learned: in this lecture we talked about spatial

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.040
image processing operators.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.500
These operations are where the output pixel
is a function of the corresponding surrounding

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
region in the input image.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.360
We talked about edge effects and this where
the input window falls off the edge of the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.760
input image and we need some sort of strategy
to deal with this particular problem.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.649
We talked about convolution; this is where
we apply a matrix which we call a kernel to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160
an image using the convolution operator.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.860
We can use this to perform a raft of really
useful image processing functions such as

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.140
smoothing and gradient calculation.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.840
We looked at a number of standard kernels
such as the Gaussian, the derivative of the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.640
Gaussian and the Laplacian of Gaussian.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
We also looked at the correlation.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.270
Correlation is similar to convolution; some
of the signs in the equation are changed and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.220
it’s equivalent to convolution if the kernel
is symmetric.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.189
Correlation is useful for tasks such as template
matching and we used this technique to find

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.509
the robot Bender in a very busy crowd scene.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.960
We also discussed non-linear filters; we talked
about rank and median filters and showed how

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.319
they are useful for removing extreme noise.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.279
We also talked about morphological image processing,
and this is a technique that allows us to

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:30.579
keep or remove blobs that are based on their
size and shape.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.240
If you have an image with small noise blobs
you can use a morphological filter to simply

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.709
remove them.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.390
Or if you have an image—perhaps the result
of thresholding, the object has got some small

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.990
holes in it that you are not happy about—you
can use a morphological processing to fill

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.889
those holes in.
