00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.990
I’d like to make a distinction between the
techniques known as image processing, and

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.500
the techniques known as computer vision.
Image processing is a technique that takes

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.480
an image and produces another image. It’s
often used for image enhancement. In this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.570
example we see a medical image where features
within the body are rather indistinct, and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.380
by applying an image processing technique
to it, they have been enhanced. They have

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.440
higher contrast and it is easier to see the
wires and other structures inside the body.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.309
Computer vision, on the other hand, or machine
vision as it’s sometimes called, takes an

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.789
image and produces features. What we see here
is an input image with a large number of coloured

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.280
pixels. Some are yellow, some are grey, some
are blue. And what it’s producing on the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
right-hand side are features which describe
just the yellow objects. And we can see here

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.690
that we’ve highlighted the centres of those
objects, and we’ve also put red boxes around

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.129
them that show their spatial extent. So we’ve
reduced the amount of information from a whole

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.660
lot of colour pixels to a bunch of quite succinct
information for coordinates of centres and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.670
the coordinates of the corners of four bounding
boxes.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.860
That pertinent information we refer to as
image features and there are really three

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.050
different kinds of image features that are
in common use. The first one is regions; the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.670
example that I just gave. For each of these
yellow objects, I might be interested in knowing

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.810
where’s their centre, how big are they,
what shape are they, what’s the orientation.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.220
Are they pointing sideways, are they pointing
vertically. And there are other features that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.209
we could use to describe the shape of these
yellow objects.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.310
Another kind of very common feature are lines.
And lines are everywhere. certainly in the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.030
built environment. So we might be interested
in what are the equations of these dominant

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.440
lines in the image. We might be interested
in the start and end points of these lines,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.860
the line segments that perhaps might delineate
an area of a roof or the edge of a building.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.810
The last kind of feature that we use in computer
vision are points. Here what I’ve done is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.910
overlaid onto a picture of a building what
are called interest points. These are points

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.050
that contain a lot of information and would
be easy to find in another view of that same

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.500
building. So the circles indicate the centre
of these interest points and the size of the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.550
circle says something about the scale of those
interest points. Now, interest points and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.570
the scale of points is not something we’re
going to cover in this lecture series, but

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.750
certainly it’s a topic about which there
is a lot of literature, and they are a very

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.730
important concept in modern computer vision.
Let’s go back again and consider region

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.400
features, which is what we are going to talk
about in this lecture. A question you might

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.080
like to ask is where are the symbols on this
sign; where are the letters and the other

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.290
graphical elements. Well if we find region
features we are able to solve this problem.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.010
And what I’ve done here with a bit of quite
simple code, is to put a bounding box around

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.610
each of the distinct white symbols on this
otherwise black sign.
