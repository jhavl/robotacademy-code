00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.910
Stereo is not the only technique that a robot
can use to determine the 3D structure of its

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.679
world. This is a very familiar device; it's
the Microsoft Connect Sensor. This is sometimes

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.109
called an RGBD camera that is it's a sensor
that returns you at each pixel, the red value,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.050
the green value, the blue value and the depth.
So, we talked earlier about color planes in

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.349
an image. The Connect Sensor returns an image
with 4 planes, R, G, B and D. The Connect

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.559
contains 2 quite separate subsystems.
The first is a fairly conventional color or

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.390
RGB camera. The second component is a laser
pattern projector. So, this is actually omitting,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.340
a pattern of infrared light onto the scene
and then, there is an infrared camera which

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.039
is observing that pattern and from the observation
of the pattern, it can determine 3-dimensional

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.059
structure.
What does this pattern looks like? It's looks

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.840
pretty speckly, Itâ€™s pretty close to a random
pattern of dots.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.850
What the Connect Sensor does is exploit a
very classical principle called structured

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.010
light. What I want to do here is to illustrate
the principles of a classical structured light

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.990
sensor.
The gray box here represents the Connect Sensor

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.299
and we have an object at some distance away
from the sensor. We have a camera which is

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.229
represented here by a pin hole camera model
with an image plane behind it and we have

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.509
a laser projector which emits a fan of rays.
Those rays intersect the object and forms

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.240
spots of light on the object. The camera observes
those spots of light and forms an image which

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.189
is a projection of those spots on the object.
Let's just make a temporary copy of where

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.670
those spots are on the image plane. Now, we're
going to consider that the object has moved

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.210
further away from the camera and we repeat
the process. The laser projector emits the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.850
same fan of laser beams. Spots are formed
on the object. Pinhole camera observes that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.560
and we see a projection on the image plane.
If we add back the previous image plane projection

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.379
which we say before, we can see that the pattern
of dots has moved. There is a vertical displacement

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.250
or a disparity that is proportional to the
object distance.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.660
So, this is the fundamental principle of structured
light. Now, we can add some additional measurements

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.410
here. We have a base line which is the distance
between the center of laser projector and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.550
the center of the camera.
The camera's got a focal length and the object

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.160
is at a distance z. Now, we can write a relationship
between all of these quantities and the disparity

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.420
is inversely proportional to the object distance
z.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.379
So, this is not exactly how the Connect works
but it's a very similar principle. On the

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.970
Connect Sensor itself, the base line then
is the distance between the center of the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.819
laser pattern projector and the center of
the infrared camera. Another principle is

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.950
what's called the time of flight camera and
what we can see here is a camera lens in the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.300
middle and on the either side of that, there
are 2 arrays of quite high power light-emitting

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.430
diodes. These diodes don't project a speckle
pattern onto the scene. They provide general

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.690
overall illumination of the scene.
The principle works something like this. The

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.530
light that's being emitted is modulated at
some quite high frequency and is reflected

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.440
off the object and picked up by the camera.
So, the modulation frequency of light might

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.659
be something like 10 or 20 megahertz. If we
plot the intensity of a light against time,

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.659
the outgoing light in red and incoming light
in blue, we see that the incoming light is

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.379
slightly delayed with respect to the outgoing
light.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.780
There is a phase shift. So, there's a delay
of T. The distance is proportional to the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.340
phase difference between the outgoing and
the incoming light. The relationship between

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.629
distance and the time delay T is given here
where C is the speed of light. Speed of light

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.120
is a very big number that means that the time
shift is very small.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.670
Typically, it's of the order of nano seconds.
This process is replicated at every single

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.090
pixel in the scene. So, we need a very special
sort of imaging sensor. One that's not just

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.629
responsive to the intensity of the incoming
light but a pixel that is responsive to phase

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.780
shift.
So, these cameras require very special sensing

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.620
chips and typically, don't have particularly
high resolution, maybe 64 by 64 pixels or

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.060
128 by 128. A generic disadvantage of this
kind of sensor and also the Connect Sensor

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.210
is that they rely on projecting light onto
the scene. This means that they don't work

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.440
particularly well outdoors where you've got
a very bright sun completely overwhelms the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.600
light that the sensor is trying to project
onto the scene.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
They do, however, work very very well indoors
and they work very very well at night where

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.740
a traditional camera will return nothing.
