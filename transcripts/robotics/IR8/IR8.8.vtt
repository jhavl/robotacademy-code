00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.049
Let's summarize some of the important concepts
that we've learned in this particular lecture.

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.760
In previous lectures we've covered the concept
of forward kinematics and inverse kinematics.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.520
This is the relationship between joint angles
and the end effector pose. In this lecture

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.780
what we talked about talked about the velocity
transform. That's the relationship between

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.830
the velocity of the joints and the velocity
of the end effector pose. We've talked about

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.180
the derivative of the pose and we discussed
intangible terms what that might mean. It

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.489
might be the end effector translational velocity
xdot and ydot. If the robot's got three degrees

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.249
of freedom, then the end effector pose velocity
is xdot ydot and theta dot.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.760
In this lecture, we introduced this symbol,
the Greek letter nu to represent what we call

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.520
the spatial velocity of the end effector.
That is the rate of change of pose with respect to time.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.949
We've introduced this relationship between
the robot joint velocity and the spatial velocity

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.130
of the robot's end effector or tooltip. These
two quantities are related by the Jacobian

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.920
matrix. The Jacobian matrix is a function
of the joint configuration represented by

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.380
the vector Q. For the case of the two-linked
robot, the spatial velocity is simply xdot

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.590
and ydot and the joint velocity is the vector
Q1dot and Q2dot. For the three-linked plain

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.409
manipulator, the joint velocities Q1dot Q2dot
Q3dot and the spatial velocity now has a translational

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.820
component xdot and ydot and a rotational velocity
component Q dot. So if we think of the robot

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.159
end effector as a pose of a coordinate frame,
this is a speed at which the origin of the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.710
coordinate frame moves and the speed in which
the coordinate frame rotates.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.399
The Jacobian matrix can sometimes be singular
or close to singular. That is its determine

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.289
very close to 0 or its condition number is
very large. And this is something about how

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.350
easy or awkward certain Cartesian motions
will be. We will quantify this a bit by talking

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.580
about the velocity ellipse of the manipulator.
What we did was to map a set of velocities

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.920
that lie on a circle in the joint velocity
space to an ellipse on the space of the Cartesian

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.030
velocity of the robot tool; xdot and ydot
in this particular case. And what we can see

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.440
is we have an ellipse which indicates that
the robot is capable of moving in this case

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.860
quite quickly in the y direction but more
slowly in the x direction. The shape of this

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.030
ellipse is a function of the joint angles
Q. The inverse Jacobian is very useful to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.070
us. It allows us to specify the spatial velocity
of a tool tip in terms of Cartesian coordinates

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.900
and determine the joint velocities that we
need in order to achieve that. This is very

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.960
useful in real world applications where we
might want the robot end effector to move

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.480
in a straight line at a determined velocity.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.140
So for a two link manipulator, we define the
end effector velocity in terms of its Cartesian

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.070
velocity components xdot and ydot and compute
the appropriate joint angle velocities. And

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.700
again for the three degree freedom robot,
we can specify not only the translational

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.150
velocity xdot and ydot we can also specify
the rotational velocity of a coordinate frame

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.460
attached to the end of the robot. This is
really useful for Cartesian motion. And this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.290
technique is referred to as resolved rate
motion control.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.510
Finally we talked about how we can translate
a velocity defined with respect to one coordinate

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.790
frame to a velocity with respect to a different
coordinate frame. The two velocities are related

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.560
by another Jacobian matrix. And that Jacobian
matrix is a function of the rotational part

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.960
of the relative pose between the two coordinate
frames.
