00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.950
Let’s use MATLAB to simulate this whole
color imaging process.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.770
To start with I am going to create again a
short hand for the units of nanometers.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.230
I am going to create a spectral region of
interest and I am going to pick a range from

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.090
350 nanometers, just above what we can see
at the blue end of the spectrum.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.300
In steps of five nanometers and I am going
to go all the way up to 800 nanometers.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.640
It is just a little bit beyond the visible
end of the spectrum at the red end.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.780
Now I am going to load some data which is
the spectrum of sunlight measured at the surface

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.649
of the earth and we use the load spectrum
function I am going to parse in the range

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.780
of wavelengths I am interested in and I am
going to ask for data from the file solar

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.670
dot dat.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.219
So this has loaded the illumination spectrum
of sunlight into the MATLAB workspace variable

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.950
called E and I can plot E against lambda and
have a look at that and there we have the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.410
spectrum wavelength across the bottom and
intensity on the vertical axis.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.610
Now I am going to load the reflectance information
for the famous red brick.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.970
Going to use the load spectrum function again,
parsing the same range of wavelengths and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.390
the data comes from the file called red brick
dot dat.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:40.380
Now I can display that in another figure,
create figure two and now I am going to plot

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.830
R against lambda and here we see the reflectance
profile of the red brick and we can see that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.540
it reflects more red light then it does blue
light.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.170
Now I can compute the luminance of the red
brick, and luminance is the product of the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.180
illuminance E and the reflectance and I use
the dot star operator because what I am going

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.900
to do is to multiply every element in E by
the corresponding element in R. E and R we

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.920
can see are both 91 by 1 element vectors,
and the product L we can see is also 91 by

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.970
1 vector.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.170
Now I can plot illuminance and we can see
it looks like this; so we have the incoming

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.900
light, has got this spectrum.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.569
The light that has been reflected off the
red brick has got a different spectrum, it

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.640
has reflected more red and it has absorbed
more blue and green.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.730
Now, we are going to load the response of
the human cones, I have also got that information

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.480
in a file that is shipped with the toolbox.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.650
Again we parse in the spectral range we are
interested in and we ask for data from the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.680
file cones dot dat.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.120
Now there are three cones, so the cones data
is a matrix that has got 91 rows and three

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.930
columns, each column corresponds to one of
the cones.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.440
Column one is the red cone, column two is
the green cone and so on.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.300
I can plot the cone responses; again, I am
going to plot them against lambda and here

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.230
we see the three cone responses, see the blue
cone, the green cone and the red cone.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.610
Now what I am going to do is plot the response
of the red cone to this incoming light.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.830
Now what I am going to do is to take the luminance
and I am going to multiply it by the red channel

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.760
of the cones response, so I am going to take
all rows in the cone response in column one.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.459
That is the column that contains information
about the red cone and here I have it, this

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.890
is the response of the red cone to the incoming
light from the red brick.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.130
The cone responds to the integral of this
function, the area underneath this curve,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.310
and we can see that this curve peaks up to
about 0.18.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.120
Let’s look at what it would be for the green
cone, so I change that number there and now

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.070
we see this is the response of the green cone.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.690
The peak is a little bit less, the peak is
now about 0.11; it is not quite high.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.780
It is the area underneath; this curve is the
response of the green cone when looking at

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.780
the red brick.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.540
Finally, the response of the blue cone is
given by this and we can see that this is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.910
a fairly low response, the peak value is only
0.005.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.290
Now I can compute a simple numerical approximation
to the area underneath the curve using some

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.000
rectangular integration.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.600
Use the MATLAB sum function and I am going
to sum the luminance multiplied by the response

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600
in the first instance.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.169
I am going to do the response of the red cone
and because it is a rectangular integration

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.630
I should properly multiply by the wavelength
step size, which is

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.630
5 nanometers, and this is the response of
the red cone.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.610
The response of the green cone would be this.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.490
Almost half the value and the response of
the blue cone is this much smaller value,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.970
about one eighth the response of the red cone
to this luminance response.
