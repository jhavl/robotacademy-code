00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.450
A rotary electric motor can be modelled by
this electrical schematic. Important components

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.349
of the model are a resistor and this is the
resistance of the armature coil.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.279
That's the electromagnet in the rotor. The
other component is a voltage source. A motor

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.099
can be used in reverse as a generator but
even when it's acting as a motor the generator

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.550
is producing a voltage that opposes the applied
voltage and this is referred to as the back

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.140
EMF. And this voltage is proportional to the
rotational speed of the motor.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.539
The current that flows into the motor is given
by the difference between the applied voltage

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.260
fee and the back EMF voltage VB divided by
the armature resistance RA.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.530
The torque generated by the motor is proportional
to the current that flows through the motor

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.019
and the proportionality constant is KM. These
two KMs have exactly the same value though

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.149
they're written typically with different units.
This one here has units of volts seconds per

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.050
radian. This one here has units of Newton
meters per Amp but with a little bit of effort

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.810
you can show that these two units are in fact
equivalent.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.390
There are two ways to control an electric
motor. We can control the voltage or we can

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.180
control the current.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.869
Let's first of all look at the voltage control
case. So we're going to adjust the voltage

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.729
that we apply to the motor and we can do that
using a power amplifier or something like

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.659
a pulse with modulator. And we'll look at
that shortly. I've written down all the relevant

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.549
equation and if I rearrange this equation
we can get an expression for the rotational

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.299
speed omega in terms of the applied voltage
the current and so on.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.659
Imagine that the motor starts at rest and
I apply a voltage, current flows and the motor

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.840
will start to increase in speed. As it does
so the back EMF will increase and eventually

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.600
the back EMF will be equal to the applied
voltage and then no current will flow into

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640
the motor. The motor will then stop accelerating
and when this occurs we have a simple expression

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.469
for Omega it's the applied voltage divided
by the motor constant.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.609
Now in practice the motor has got friction
and in practice that makes the speed of the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.720
motor less than the value shown here. The
important take away is that the speed of the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.970
motor is proportional to the applied voltage.
The most common way to drive an electric motor

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.730
today is with what's called an H bridge circuit.
It comprises four switches and theyâ€™re typically

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.190
some kind of field effect transistor. They're
very small and they're very efficient when

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.270
they're closed they have a very very small
resistance.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.700
As shown here no current can flow through
the motor but if I close two of the switches

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.440
then we see the current will flow through
the motor in one particular direction and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.680
the motor will rotate in the forward direction.
If I open those two switches and close the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.220
other two, current flows in the other direction
through the motor and the motor rotates backwards.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.890
One of the advantages of these electronic
fed switches is that we can them on and off

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.360
very quickly. The voltage that's applied to
the motor can be the maximum value for a time

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.020
period which we refer to as the on time and
there can zero for what we refer to as the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.980
off time. And the electronics which is driving
the H bridge circuit is able to control the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.010
duty cycle. That's the ratio of the on time
to the period and this can vary from the voltage

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.140
being always off to the voltage being always on.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.490
The motor responds to the average voltage.
So here's an example where the duty cycle

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.050
is relatively low that is the voltage is off
for more time than it is on. And the motor

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.070
sees an effective average voltage shown by
the red line as I increase the duty cycle

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.760
the average voltage rises and I can increase
the duty cycle even further.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.280
So by adjusting the duty cycle which is something
that a micro controller can do quite easily,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.530
we can control the average voltage in an almost
continuous fashion. This switching happens

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.560
very very quickly, typically a frequency of
at least 1 kHz.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.110
An alternative way of controlling the electric
motor is to regulate the current that flows

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.990
into the motor. There are many ways to create
a control current source.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.610
A common way is to take a control voltage
source and apply a current feedback loop.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.520
The torque generated by the motor is proportional
to the current flowing through the motor.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.320
The torque is also equal to the rotational
inertia of the motor multiplied by its rotational

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.770
acceleration. This is the rotational equivalent
of the equation F = MA. Now we can write an

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.150
expression for the rotational acceleration of the motor in terms of the current flowing into the motor.
