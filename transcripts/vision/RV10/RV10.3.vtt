00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.879
Let's talk some more about binocular disparity.
As I mentioned before itâ€™s a technique that's

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.349
very widespread through animals and it's also
a techniques that's used in robotics.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.020
A good way to try and understand the principle
of binocular disparity is to look at this

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.859
very old-fashioned stereo photograph. It's
a pair of photographs of the same scene but

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.150
each image is being taken from a slightly
different viewpoint and this corresponds to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.289
the viewpoint from our left eye and our right
eye.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.450
This is separated by that 8 to 10 centimetres
and they give you a very slightly different

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.149
view of the world. Initial inspection of this
stereo photograph indicates that there's not

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.860
much difference. If we zoom in on a couple
of there is here, we see that in the left

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.989
hand image, there's quite a gap and there's
in fact no gap in the right hand image.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.250
If we look on the other side of the picture,
we look at this bench. It's quite close to

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.050
the edge of the image in the left picture
and there is a bit of a gap between the edge

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.399
and the bench in the right hand image. It's
this very subtle differences in the image

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.220
taken from these 2 viewpoints that gives us
this very vivid 3-dimensional perception of

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.350
the world that's around us.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.560
The fundamental principle of stereo disparity
is that the image depends on the camera position

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.520
and we can demonstrate that pretty easily.
If I move my head, if I translate my head

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.200
from the right through to the left then, everything
that's in the world appears to move to the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.530
right but importantly, things that are close
to me like this robot here, appear to move

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.100
a lot in the image as I do that shift. Whereas
things that are far away like the bookcase,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.180
appear to move much less.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.920
The people have been interested in capturing
stereo photographs for a very very long time.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.979
This is a lovely picture I found of a commercial
stereo film camera from the 1950's. A more

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.899
modern version of a stereo camera, this is
a digital stereo camera of this type that's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.820
quite widely used for robotic systems.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.719
Let's now try and understand what precisely
are the differences between the left hand

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.770
image and the right hand image of the same
scene. This is a pair of high-resolution digital

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.310
images of a pile of rocks.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.720
I'm going to draw a line from the left hand
edge of the image to a fairly distinctive

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.410
blotch on one of the rocks and I'm going to
draw the same length line in the right hand

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.379
image. The yellow line has gone too far to
the right and in fact, we need to go back

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.040
the distance in order to get to this distinctive
mark on the rock.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.099
Let's pick another distinctive feature at
the back of the scene here. So, I'm going

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.340
to draw a yellow line from the left hand edge
to the edge of one of the large blocks at

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.860
the back. I draw the same line in the right
hand image and again, we see that it's overshot,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.620
the corresponding point and I need to go back the distance in order to get to that corresponding point.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.380
We noticed 2 important things. First of all,
we noticed that points in the right hand image

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.819
are shifted somewhat to the left and this
shift, this horizontal displacement is referred

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.419
to as disparity. We also note that the shift is less for points that are further away from the camera.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.620
So, here we have a stereo camera and it's
observing an object, a ball and that is at

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.190
distance Z away from the camera. We refer
to the base line of the stereo camera, that's

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.989
the distance between the centre of the lenses
and F is the focal length of the lens. We

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.569
assume that both lenses have the same focal
length.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.390
Now, this is a very simple relationship between
these quantities and that is that the disparity

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.230
is proportional to the focal length and base
line divided by the distance. So, if we know

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.250
the focal length. We know the base line and
we know the disparity in the image then, we

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.680
could estimate Z. This is the fundamental
underlying principle of robotic stereovision,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.320
sometimes it's called computational stereo and implicitly, it's what happens in our own visual system.
