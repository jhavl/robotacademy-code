00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.900
In the previous lecture when we were discussing
2-dimensional worlds, we introduced the concept

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.980
of a right-handed coordinate frame.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.100
And, just to remind you, the right-handed
coordinate frame is constructed like this.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.200
We draw the x-axis and then we swing the y-axis
up by 90 degrees.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.050
A three-dimensional coordinate frame is actually
very similar to the two-dimensional coordinate

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.050
frame.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.370
So, here is the two-dimensional right-handed
coordinate frame that we just introduced.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.560
And, what I’m going to do do now is to rotate
that in three dimensions.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.790
And, what we see is that the z-axis was previously
hidden.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.980
Previously, it was sticking up at us out of
the screen.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.680
To create a 3-dimensional right-handed coordinate
frame, we start in a similar way.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.470
We draw the x-axis.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.370
We swing the y-axis so that it makes an angle
of 90 degrees to the x-axis.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.420
And then, we swing the z-axis upwards and
it also makes an angle of 90 degrees to the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.160
x-axis and also makes an angle of 90 degrees
to the y-axis.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.250
There’s a very close relationship between
the 2-dimensional and the 3-dimensional coordinate

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.250
frames.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.680
Let me put down the two-dimensional coordinate
frame and here is three-dimensional coordinate

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.680
frame.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.560
And, I can overlay the x-axis and the y-axis
and we see that the z-axis points upwards.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.150
We refer to this as a right-handed coordinate
frame.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.460
And, the reason we call it a right-handed
frame is the orientation of the axes can be

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.140
defined very simply using my right hand.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.030
So, this is the x-axis.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.030
This is the y-axis.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.710
And, this is the z-axis pointing upwards.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.280
So, whenever we’re doing work with 3-dimensional
coordinate frames, they are always right-handed

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.119
coordinate frames.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.530
This particular coordinate frame that I built,
we have an x-axis and a y-axis and this one,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.619
the z-axis pointing downwards.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.520
This is a left-handed coordinate frame.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.650
So it’s best not to use these, they are
going to cause you all sorts of grief.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.880
So, don’t use left-handed coordinate frames.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.409
Go with the right-handed coordinate frame.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.550
So, just to recap.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.280
When we create a right-handed coordinate frame,
we use this rule what’s called the right-handed

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.420
rule, and I take my right hand.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.810
The x-axis is parallel to my thumb.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.170
The y-axis is parallel to my index finger.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.739
And, the z-axis is parallel to my middle finger.
