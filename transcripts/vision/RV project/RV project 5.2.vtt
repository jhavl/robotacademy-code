00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.091
I'd like to talk to you now about the importance
of homographies and why we need to apply it

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:12.380
to the robotic vision worksheet. I've put
together some tips and tricks to improve your

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.529
homography. So let's go into MATLAB now and
take a look at these.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.650
Okay so how does a homography actually work?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.640
What does it describe?

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.279
Well if I look at the output of my tracked
mark script you can see I have these two figures.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.169
Now on the left hand side I have my rectified
image with the calibration circles marked

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.340
with red asterisks. And on the right hand
side I have my regional robotic vision worksheet

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.980
image and the calibrations circles are marked
as well.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.120
So what homography does is that I give it
the points of the circles on the right hand

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.829
side in this image and then I also compare
that to the calibration circle positions on

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.129
the left hand side and homography generates
a matrix which describes the relationship

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.500
between these two different viewpoints.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.170
So once I have the relationship I can then
rectify the entire image from that H matrix

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.530
alone. So that is a very powerful tool and
allows us to do some cool things with computer

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.040
vision and robotics.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.320
Okay so that's what a homography matrix is.
Alright so what are some tips and tricks when

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.630
you're writing your own getHomography function.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.960
My first tip is that you need to make sure
that all the calibrations circles are in the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.270
image. Alright so if you don't have all the
circles in there then it's going to very difficult

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.250
to generate a homography matrix.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.070
The next tip is that the blob centroids that
you get from identifying the blue circles.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.490
The centroid of that blob needs to be almost
on top of the centroid in the actual image.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.290
Alright so if there's any misalignment between
the two centroids then the homography matrix

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.540
that you generate may not describe the relationship
between the different viewpoints that well.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.659
The third tip is that because a homography
describes the plainer relationship between

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.521
two different viewpoints of your camera you
need to make sure that the worksheet is as

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.950
flat as possible. So make sure there are no
creases or folds in the worksheet. Because

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.390
once again if you do have any of those then
the homography matrix will not describe the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.640
relationship that well between the two different
viewpoints.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.739
And finally and probably the most important
point is that a homography works off the correspondences

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.400
between the points in two different views.
So you can see I've labeled my circles here

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.980
on the right and left hand side of the image.
And these numbers are correspond to the ordering

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.120
of the points that I supplied it when I generated
my homography.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.360
So you need to make sure that the ordering
or the correspondence of the points is correct

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.620
such that you can generate the H matrix the
way you want to. And the way I did mine was

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.989
that I identified where the large blue circle
was, as you can see here's the circle number

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.030
two with the green asterisks. And because
I confined the large blue circle I could then

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.129
rectify my image on the left hand side here
such that the X and Y Cartesian coordinates

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.409
was located at the top left hand side of my
rectified image.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:23.610
And the final thing to note is that you can
check the quality of your homography matrix

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.750
by looking at the residual so let's take a
look at that now.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:37.530
Alright so let's look at my "getHomography"
function and check its residual on the output.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.599
So you can see that the residual that's generated
is 1, 1.08 and that's really good, but what

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.909
does this residual mean?

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.709
Where does it come from?

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.150
Okay so if we have a look at the points that
I supplied to getHomography. I have P1 which

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.330
is the position of the circles in the X and
Y Cartesian coordinates. And P2 is the other

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.170
set of coordinates and that is the position
of the pixel centroids.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.569
So what the residual is that it is the error
that's generated when you do the rectification

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.660
of the points so if I use the homtrans function
you can see where it comes about.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.440
So while you homtrans on P2, you can see that
this is the point positions in the rectified

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.130
image and you can see when you compare the
output of homtrans to P1 that a matches quite

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.669
closely to other position that I want in the
alternate view.

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.150
But they're not quite exact. So there's a
residual when you do this comparison. And

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.680
this is where this maximum residual value
comes from. So when you do do your homography,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.169
always check to the residual and to make sure
that it's not too large. A large residual

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.580
indicates that the homography matrix that
you generated poorly describes the relationship

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.330
between the two different viewpoints that
you supplied to the homography function.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.090
So those are my tips and tricks on homographies.
Good luck with writing your own functions

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.139
and make sure you do the getCalibration function
and the getHomography function this week.
