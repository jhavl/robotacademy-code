00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.379
Letâ€™s summarise what we have learned in
this lecture.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.800
MATLAB supports a number of operations between
matrices and scalars, and matrices and matrices.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.439
In the case of a matrix and a scalar, what
happens is that the scalar is applied to every

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.619
element of the input matrix and those results
are placed into the corresponding elements

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.630
of the output matrix.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.730
The sorts of operators we can use between
a matrix and a scalar include the standard

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.480
arithmetic operators and they also include
the logical operators, which perform logical

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.800
comparisons, and which have a result which
is either true of false.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.430
When we perform an operation between a matrix
and a matrix, the matrices need to be the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.260
same size and the operations are performed
between corresponding elements of the matrix.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.969
Results are placed into the corresponding
element of the output matrix.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.739
MATLAB supports a number of logical operators.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.500
The results of logical operator are only true
or false and we can perform a number of different

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.390
logical tests: equality; non-equality; greater
than; less than; and so on.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.550
We have talked about monadic image processing
and that is where individual pixels in the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.470
input image are passed through a function
f(x) and the result is placed into the corresponding

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.030
element in the output matrix.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.920
We apply the same function to all pixels and
we looked at a number of operations such as

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.170
contrast; enhancement; brightness change;
histogram normalization; thresholding; posterization;

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.220
and so on.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.390
And there are many, many, more.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.840
The other class of operation we looked at
are what we called diadic operations and here

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.310
we have two input images, passed through a
function and the output value is placed into

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.920
the corresponding pixel in the output image.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.090
Some examples of diadic operations were image
subtraction, which we used to find the difference

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.960
between two input scenes.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.260
We also used the number of different diadic
operations in performing quite a sophisticated

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.250
image processing task, which is implementing
the green screen effect.
