00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.869
In the last lecture we talked about how we
described the position of objects in a two

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.050
dimensional world.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.380
We used the example, for instance, a robot
and we created a two dimensional coordinate

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380
frame.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.210
We placed the coordinate frame at a reference
location and we can describe the position

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.520
of the robot with respect to that co-ordinate
frame.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.140
We also talked about how we describe the orientation
of the object; that is which way the robot

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.469
is pointing with respect to the axes on this
co-ordinate frame.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.489
Now what we are going to do is to kick it
up a level of complexity and introduce the

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.570
third dimension.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.910
So for most robotics the third dimension is
really important.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.350
The robots hand for instance, in any sort
of real robot, the hand is going to move in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.460
a plane, but it is also going to be able to
move up and down.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.720
So we need to be able to describe the position
and orientation of bodies in three-dimensional

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.720
space.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.329
But there are also a lot of robots that move
in three-dimensional space.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.110
So here I have a model airplane, or course
an airplane flies through the air.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.409
It goes up and it goes down.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.130
It can move left and right, and it can also
rotate in a number of interesting ways.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.200
It can pitch up and down, it can yaw like
this, and it can roll like this.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.280
So underwater robots are another example,
they are a bit like this but instead of flying

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.390
through the air, they are flying through the
water.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.690
So these are two really important classes
of robots today, robots that fly and robots

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.700
that swim under the water and their motion
is described in terms of three-dimensional

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700
space.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.619
Where perhaps a simple wheeled robot like this,
we could get by with just describing it’s

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.380
position and it’s orientation in terms of
two-dimensional space.
