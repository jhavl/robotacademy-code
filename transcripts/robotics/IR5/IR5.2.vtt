00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.120
To make it tangible, we are going to consider
the example of my mobile phone.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.990
First thing I am going to do is to attach
a right handed coordinate frame to it and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.880
I am going to have the z-axis out of the face
of the screen.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.850
The y-axis is vertically upwards on the phone
and the x-axis is horizontal from left to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.850
right.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.710
I am going to call this frame B and that stands
for the body frame or the body-fixed frame.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.570
This is a very common notation in aerospace
and also in robotics.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.960
Now we are going to place one accelerometer
aligned with each of the axes that we have

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960
attached to the phone.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.360
So, one accelerometer would be in XB direction
and one in the YB direction and one in the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.860
ZB direction.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.180
Modern mobile phones, are packed full of inertial
sensors.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.540
They contained three accelerometers, three
gyros and three magnetometers.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.739
Like everything else that we've talked about
in this lecture series, we are going to attach

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.430
a coordinate frame to the phone.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.761
You have to look reasonably deeply into the
documentation to find the coordinate frame

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:09.049
conventions for the phone, but for an iPhone
like this, the convention is the x-axis is

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.310
to the right and the y-axis is to the top
of the phone and the z-axis is out of the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.310
screen.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.909
So, I am going to fix one of my standard coordinate
frames to the phone, so we understand what's

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.409
what.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.319
There are many apps that you can get for your
phone, that report the acceleration measurement

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.250
recorded by the sensors built into the phone
itself.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.529
Unfortunately, many of these apps introduce
a negative sign.

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.350
That means that if the phone is sitting flat
on the table, it reports a value of minus

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.520
1G in the negative z or down with the direction
but as we discussed in the previous section,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
acceleration of a device sitting flat on a
table should be 1G in the positive upward

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
x direction.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.989
So, here we have the plumb bob, which is hanging
down under the force of gravity, so it is

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:02.560
aligned parallel to the gravitational acceleration
with the same gravitational acceleration is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.999
parallel to the z-axis.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.179
If I rotate the phone like this, so now, the
gravitational acceleration is parallel to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.230
the y-axis and now I can rotate the phone,
so the gravitational acceleration is parallel

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.540
to the x-axis.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.650
Let us consider now the problem of determining
the orientation of the phone with respect

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.920
to a world coordinate frame.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.080
The world coordinate frame is shown here in
blue and its origin shows that the z-axis

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.140
is upwards and parallel to the gravity vector.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
Frame B, the body frame is attached rigidly
to the phone.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.730
Now I can write an expression for the orientation
of the phone with respect to the world coordinate

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.920
frame and I will do that in terms of yaw,
pitch and roll angles which are successive

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.030
rotations about the z-axis, the y-axis and
then the x-axis.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.740
This is the gravitational acceleration in
the world frame because the world z-axis is

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.560
parallel to the gravitational acceleration
vector.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.640
We note here that G is positive.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.739
We are talking about acceleration in the world
frame is G in the upward direction.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.019
It is very easy to rotate this gravitational
acceleration with respect to the world frame

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.200
into the body frame.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.900
This is what the sensors in the phone actually
measure.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.150
They are measuring gravity with respect to
frame B. It is really important to note that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.950
this assumes that the phone is not accelerating.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.310
The only acceleration on the body is that
due to gravity.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.709
Now, I can expand out the right hand side
and I can replace the left hand side with

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.909
the gravity actually measured by the sensors
in the phone.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.870
I have a very simple vector equation.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.340
If I take the first row in this vector equation.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.140
I can rearrange it to get a solution for the
pitch angle theta.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.760
If I take the quotient of the last two rows
in the vector equation, I get this expression

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.379
for the roll angle of the phone.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.879
Two very simple equations based on the measured
acceleration give me the roll and pitch angle

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.590
of the phone with respect to the world coordinate
frame.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.560
Then you note in this equation that yaw angle
does not appear.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.040
A simple way to think about why this is the
case, is that the gravity vector has got three

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.370
elements but its length is fixed therefore
we can define it by only two pieces of information.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.729
The third element of the gravity vector is
redundant.

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.289
In this case, the two pieces of information
that we need are the roll angle and the pitch

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.289
angle.

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.699
We do not need the yaw angle.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.000
To measure the yaw angle, we need to use a
different sensor and that sensor is actually

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.050
a compass and that is the topic of our next
section.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.639
An important consideration when we use three
accelerometers, is that it measures only two

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.139
independent variables.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.250
The length of the vector is fixed, so therefore,
we can describe that vector just in terms

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.250
of two angles.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.950
We can see that very clearly when the phone
is configured like this.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.020
Zero acceleration in the Z and the X directions.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.370
The acceleration is all in the Y direction.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.130
So the accelerometer measurements are exactly
the same with the phone orientated like this,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.150
or like this or like this.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.860
It makes absolutely no difference.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.039
Accelerometers today have very low cost but
very, very high in performance.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.889
Part of the reason for this is that they are
manufactured in enormous quantities.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.500
They're use to trigger airbags in cars.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.730
They're used in digital cameras to work out
whether the camera is in landscape or portrait

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.730
mode.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.669
They're used in your phone for all sorts of
different applications and they're use the

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.129
stabilization of unmanned area of vehicles
from low cost toys like this to much more

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.580
sophisticated systems.
