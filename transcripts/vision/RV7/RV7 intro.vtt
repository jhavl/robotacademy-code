00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.010
So far in this lecture series, we've assumed
the presence of an image. We've taken an image

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.119
from a file. We've taken an image from a camera
attached to our computer. We've grabbed an

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.410
image from the Internet. It's time now to
talk about how images are actually formed.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.829
Images are formed within cameras and they
are actually formed on the retina at the back

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.129
of our eye. There's a really fascinating aspect
of image formation, we take the three dimensional

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.800
world that we live in, that's very real to
us and we project it into two dimensions.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
So when we have an image, a photograph or
something like that, it's flat, it's only

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.280
two-dimensional. So we've taken three-dimensional things and transformed it into two-dimensional things.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
We only had three dimensions to start with,
so we've thrown away one, now we've got two.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.659
There's got to be some consequence of that.
There are some very interesting consequences

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.900
of trying to crunch three dimensions down
into two.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.869
But there's another really interesting aspect
of this. And that is if I look at a photograph

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.990
of a landscape, it looks three dimensional
to me, even though I know it's flat, it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.580
a photograph, I can run my hand over it, it
is perfectly flat. So there's some magic going

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.990
on in my head, where I'm reconstructing dimensions
that don't actually exist and that just comes

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.640
from my own personal experience of the three
dimensional nature of the world; my brain

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.860
fills in this extra dimension.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.720
So these are the aspects of image formation
that I want to talk about in this group of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.200
three lectures. In this lecture we're going
to look out how images are formed using pinhole

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.850
cameras and cameras with lenses and the treatment
in this lecture is all going to be geometric;

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.600
it's about similar triangles. We're also going
to look at a few different types of cameras;

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.770
we're going to look at fisheye cameras and
panoramic cameras and a very new type of camera

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.420
called a "Light Field Camera".
