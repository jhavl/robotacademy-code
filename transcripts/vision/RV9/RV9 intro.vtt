00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.630
In this lecture we're going to continue an
earlier discussion about image processing

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.060
and pick up on a couple of more advance techniques
that are interesting and useful. Image processing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.939
is are really huge area.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.460
There are some massive textbooks that cover
it in a lot of detail. Much more detail and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.700
than I can hope to do here. But I want to
just introduce you to a couple of techniques

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.690
that I think really are useful.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.300
The first thing we going to reveal is the
mathematical morphology. And where we left

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.670
it, we could use shape filters that could
detect squares or rectangles of different

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.510
sizes. Here we going to extend that and look
at how we can detect shapes that are perhaps

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.640
diagonal lines or circles.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.280
The second technique we are going to visit
is what we call image warping. This is a fairly

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.030
general technique that allows us to change
the shape of an image and we are going to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.619
look at some examples about how we can make
an image larger or smaller, about how we can

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.780
rotate an image or about how we can shift
an image.
