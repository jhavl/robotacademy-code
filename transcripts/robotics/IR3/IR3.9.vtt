00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.500
Peter: Lets have another look at converting
roll/pitch/yaw angles to a rotation matrix.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.160
We use the function that we introduced a moment
ago; rpy2r, and I’m going to pass in a roll

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.820
angle of 0.3 radians, a pitch radians of pi/2
radians, and a yaw angle of 0.5 radians. And

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.960
as before we have an orthonormal rotation
matrix.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
Now I’m going to convert that back to roll/pitch/yaw
angles. To do that I use the inverse function

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.050
tr2rpy and I pass in the rotation matrix that
we just computed, and here are the roll/pitch/yaw

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.649
angles. You’ll notice they are quite different
to those that we passed in. The middle angle,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.430
the pitch angle is the same, its pi/2. The
roll angle has changed from 0.3 to 0, and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.100
the yaw angle has changed form 0.5 to 0.8.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.809
If you are sharp you’ll have noticed that
0.8 is the sum of 0.3 and 0.5. So one of our

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.680
angles has got 0, and the yaw angle has gone
to the sum of the original roll and yaw angles.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.840
What’s going on here?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.510
This is a condition known as singularity,
and it occurs in any three-angle sequence

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.520
representation of an orientation. It occurs
for roll/pitch/yaw angles, it occurs for Euler

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.550
angles. It always occurs when the middle angle
takes on a particular value, and for roll/pitch

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.560
/yaw angles the pitch angle is equal to pi/2,
leads to the singularity condition.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.310
This condition is also known by the rather
unusual name of gimbal lock. If you’ve ever

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.440
seen the movie Apollo 13 you will have heard
that term used.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.710
Apollo 13 is actually one of my favourite
movies. It’s a dramatisation of the very

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.360
famous Apollo 13 mission to the moon back
in 1970.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.030
Astronaut: Ok Houston we’ve had a problem
here.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.700
Ground Controller: This is Houston, say again
please.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.430
Astronaut: Alright Houston we’ve had a problem.
We’ve had a Main B Bus undervolt.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.530
Peter: There was a faulty component built
into the spacecraft and eventually caused

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.320
a massive explosion. The moon landing was
aborted and the astronauts were really lucky

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.009
to get back to earth alive.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.780
The explosion presented the astronauts and
NASA ground staff with all kinds of problems;

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.670
saving the crew’s oxygen, removing excess
carbon dioxide, dealing with power shortage,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.280
and devising a strategy for getting the astronauts
safely back to Earth.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.129
A rather more obscure element of this dramatic
crisis is gimbal lock. It is a pretty esoteric

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.700
term. It’s a very geeky term, and I'm pretty
sure it's also the first and perhaps the last

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.519
time it will ever be mentioned in a Hollywood
movie!

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.030
The problem first of all was picked up by
the ground controllers, as they monitor the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.269
crew onboard trying to stabilise the stricken
spacecraft.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.090
Ground Controller: 13, Houston. We see you
getting close to gimbal lock there. We’d

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.670
like you to bring up all Quad C’s on Main
A. Quad C1, C2, C3 and C4 on Main A, and also

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420
bring B3 and B4 up on Main A.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.420
Peter: The pilot was trying desperately to
keep it away from the Gimbal lock condition.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.659
Ground Controller: 13, Houston. Do you read?

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.980
Astronaut: Yeah we got it.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.200
Peter: The Apollo spacecraft’s flying controls
were something like those seen in this NASA testbed.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.280
This gimbal lock condition is related to the
example that we were looking at in MATLAB

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.920
a moment ago but in this case, in the NASA
case, they were dealing with real physical

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.959
gimbals. So let's have a look at physical
gimbals and how they work.

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.279
A Gimbal is a simple mechanism that's used
to keep a delicate instrument like a compass

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:46.029
or a clock, level when it's mounted on a vehicle
or a vessel that's undergoing considerable

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:52.900
motion. And the first example here is a compass
in we call a two axis Gimbal, so the compass

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.760
can rotate around this particular axis and
then that whole assembly rotates around this

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.200
axis. Or if the base of the compass was mounted
on the ship and the ship is rolling and pitching

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.749
then the compass is going to remain level.
The same for this clock indicated here, its

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:19.060
first free to rotate around this axis and
then it's free to rotate around this axis.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.890
If I place this box on the table in my cabin
on board a sailing ship then the clock is

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.730
going to remain level even though the ship
is undergoing quite considerable motion. This

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.810
last example is a little bit more complex
it contains what we call a three axis Gimbal.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.720
In the first case then, the compass is free
to rotate around this axis and then that whole

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.290
assembly is free to rotate around this axis
and finally all that inner assembly is

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.070
free to rotate around this axis.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.720
Gimbals are widely used in engineering systems
and this is a schematic of a gimbal that was

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.480
part of the navigation system for the Apollo
lunar module that was referred to earlier

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.480
in the movie. The key component is what's
called the stabilized platform and it consists

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.920
of three gyroscopes spinning quickly and they
keep this particular assembly shown here in

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.130
blue at a fixed orientation with respect to
the universe. Now because the vehicle in which

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.920
it's mounted is going to be rotating and translating,
then we need some way to mechanically connect

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.300
the space craft to the stable platform but
in such a way that the motion of the space

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.080
craft does not introduce any torque or force
on the stable platform. So the way to do that

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.490
is to use a series of gimbals so the first
gimbal is a rotation around this axis here

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.860
and then that whole assembly is free to rotate
around this axis and then finally all that

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:59.190
assembly is free to rotate around this axis.
What this allows is really important, if we

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.020
measure the angles of the shaft in each of
the gimbals then that tells us the orientation

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.390
of the vehicle with respect to the stable
platform. And that's how this vehicle is able

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.810
to determine it's orientation in space. The
problem occurs when the angle of the second

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.350
gimbal approaches plus or minus 90 degrees
and that's the condition referred to as Gimbal

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.630
Lock which was mentioned in the movie clip.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.630
For space craft navigation it works something
like this, we have this inner element which

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.650
is referred to as a stable platform, it's
got three orthogonal gyroscopes on it and

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.800
what that means is that the platform maintains
a constant orientation with respect to the

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.160
universe. It's a very impressive thing, the
space craft then is attached to the other

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.130
side of the gimbal mechanism. So as the space
craft's orientation changes over time by reading

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.040
the gimbal angles we can determine the orientation
of the space craft with respect to the stable

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.980
platform whose orientation is a constant.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.000
Let's consider the case where the orientation
of the vehicle is expressed in terms of roll,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.290
pitch, yaw angles. We write this as a sequence
of elementary rotations, a rotation around

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.170
the X axis by the roll angle, rotation around
the Y axis by the pitch angle and a rotation

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.710
around the Z axis by the yaw angle. Now let's
consider what happens when the pitch angle

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:27.510
equals 90 degrees or pi on 2 radians. We
can write the expression like this, now the

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.270
pitch angle is equal to pi on 2 and with some
well known identities I can rewrite it in

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.130
this form. Now what we have is 2 consecutive
rotations around the X axis so I can write

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:46.550
this now as a single rotation around the X
axis. The amount of the rotation is R+Y, it's

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.930
the sum of the roll angle and the yaw angle
and there's a final constant rotation. What

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:58.610
this indicates is that now roll and yaw are
equivalent we can't tell one from another.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.270
Another way to think about this mechanical
way in terms of the Gimbal mechanism itself

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.800
is to think that the axis of the first gimbal
and the third gimbal and now parallel to each

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:16.010
other and aligned. This is a mathematical
representation of the Gimbal lock phenomenon.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:21.310
And it occurs when the angle of the middle
gimbal approaches pi on 2. This is the condition

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.100
that they were concerned about in the Apollo
13 clip.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.070
So what this means is when you define your
coordinate system for any particular vehicle

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.589
and if you want to describe it's orientation
in terms of roll, pitch and yaw angles it's

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:43.180
important that the pitch angle is around 0
for the nominal configuration of your vehicle.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:49.410
So if it's an aircraft then the pitch angle
would be 0 when it is in default horizontal configuration

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.779
or as if it was a rocket you would want to
make sure that the 0 pitch angle corresponded

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:59.779
to the condition of going straight up. You
need to ensure that the situation with the

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:04.980
pitch angle equals plus or minus 2 does not
occur during normal operating conditions.
