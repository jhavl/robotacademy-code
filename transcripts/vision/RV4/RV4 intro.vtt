00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.300
In the last lecture we looked at image processing
operations, where each pixel in the output

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.730
image is computed from the corresponding pixel
in the input image; or from two input images

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.109
in what we called "The Diadic Case". In this
lecture we're going to consider what we call

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.380
"Spatial Imaging Processing Operations" and
here the output pixel is a function of the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.690
corresponding pixel in the input image and
a region of pixels around that input pixel.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.960
And this enables us to do some pretty interesting
things. It allows us to smooth an image, it

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.780
allows us to find edges with an image and edges are a very useful structure to use for robotic vision.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.520
The other sort of filter we're going to talk
about in this lecture is what we call "Morphological

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.220
Filtering" and these are filters that are sensitive to particular shapes within the input image.
