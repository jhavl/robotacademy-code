00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.390
Let’s summarise some of the concepts that
we’ve learned in this lecture. It’s all

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.370
being about motion in three-dimensional space.
First of all, we introduced the concept of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.160
translational velocity that is the rate of
change of the X, Y and Z components of a point

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.150
in space and we define that with respect to
a reference coordinate frame.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.460
We introduced the concept of angular velocity
and that is a vector quantity. The direction

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.869
of the vector is the axis about which the
body is rotating at that instance in time

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.050
and the magnitude of the vector is the rate
of rotation. Angular velocity has three components:

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.070
ωx, ωy, and ωz defined with respect to
a reference coordinate frame.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.690
Translational velocity V and angular velocity
ω are combined into a quantity we referred

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.030
to as spatial velocity or sometimes referred
to as twist. It’s a six-element vector.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.060
We introduced a skew symmetric matrix. This
is a matrix whose transpose is equal to the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.439
negative of itself. When we are talking about
rotation in three dimensions, the relevant

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.000
skew symmetric matrix is a 3.3 element matrix
which is a function of a vector. There is

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.510
a really important relationship between the
angular velocity of that body and the time

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.470
derivative of the rotation matrix.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.890
For a robot with six joints, we can write
a relationship like this, which relates the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.060
rate of change of the robot joint angles to
this spatial velocity of the robots end effector,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.280
and the relationship is in terms of a six
by six Jacobian matrix which we denote by

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.270
the symbol J. The Jacobian matrix is a function
of the joint angles themselves.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.520
We can write this general relationship between
the robot joint angle velocity Qdot and spatial

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.420
velocity in terms of the Jacobian matrix.
If the Jacobian matrix is square, then we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
can invert the relationship and that allows
us to transform a desired spatial velocity

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.380
for the robot’s end effector into the joint
angle rates of the robots’ motors need to attain.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.740
The motion of any robot joint affects the
spatial velocity of the robot’s end effector.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.960
We can think of the columns of the Jacobian
matrix as described at that relationship.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.450
The first column tells us how the spatial
velocity is affected by the first joint. The

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.180
second column tells us how the spatial velocity
is affected by the second joint and so on.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.690
We can think of it as a summation of the effect
of each of the individual joints, we add them

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.360
all together to determine the overall spatial
velocity of the robot’s end effector.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.250
In some cases, the robot Jacobian can be singular
and that’s when more than one joint cause

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.060
exactly the same motion of the robot end effector,
that there are two columns in the Jacobian

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.280
matrix which are identical and that makes
the robot singular.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.220
For robots that move in three-dimensional
space, the Jacobian matrix always has six

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.010
roles but the number of columns is equal to
the number of joints that the robot has. If

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.970
the robot got six joints, the Jacobian matrix
will be square and we can invert it so long

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.090
as the robot is not in a singular configuration.
For a robot with less than six joints which

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.840
we refer to as an under-actuated robot, the
Jacobian is not square. In order to square

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.040
it up so we can use it for control purposes,
we need to eliminate some rows in that Jacobian

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.530
matrix. For the case of a robot with more
than six joints, which we refer to as an over-actuated

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.680
robot, the Jacobian has many more columns
than has rows. If we want to invert it for

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.709
control purposes, we need to use a technique
called the Pseudo Inverse. We can also think

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.610
about the robot like this as having a large
number of spare joints and we can use this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.830
to control the configuration with the shape
of the robot arm independently of the pose

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.959
of its end effector. We refer to this as null
space motion.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.870
We can transform velocity expressed with respect
to one frame to velocity with respect to another

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.920
frame by a Jacobian matrix, and that Jacobian
matrix is a function of the relative pose

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.599
between the two frames. In particular, it’s
a function of the relative orientation between

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.569
the two coordinate frames.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.170
We can use that velocity transform technique
in order to determine the robot’s end-effector

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.290
spatial velocity with respect to the end-effector
coordinate frame rather than the world coordinate

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.720
frame, and that’s typically a very useful
and convenient thing to have. We can therefore define

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.760
a variant of the Jacobian matrix which gives us the velocity in frame six, the end-effector coordinate frame.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.680
Angular velocity is a somewhat abstract concept
that’s a little difficult to visualize.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.750
We often talk about the orientation of a body
in terms of its roll, pitch, and yaw angles

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.160
so it’s more intuitive to express the rotational
velocity of an object in terms of the rates

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.919
of change of its roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
We can derive a 3x3 Jacobian matrix which

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.620
transforms roll, pitch, and yaw angle rates
into traditional angular velocity. Then we

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.880
can introduce a variant of a spatial velocity
vector and we replace the angular velocity

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.590
component with a roll, pitch, yaw velocity
component. This leads to something called

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.020
the Analytic Jacobian matrix and this maps
robot joint angle rates to the modified spatial

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.199
velocity vector.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.160
We introduced the concept of the velocity
ellipsoid in three dimensions. The ellipsoid

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.940
says something about the ability of the robot
to achieve velocity in different directions

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.110
in three-dimensional space. The end-effector
is able to move most quickly in the direction

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.699
parallel to the longest axis of the ellipsoid
and it moves most slowly parallel to the direction

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.290
of the shortest axis of the ellipsoid. We
can describe the overall shape of the ellipsoid

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.509
in terms of a scalar measure which we call
manipulability, and it says something about

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.919
the compactness of the ellipsoid. If the manipulability
is equal to one, the ellipsoid is in fact

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.979
the sphere, and we refer to this as the isotropic
motion case. The robot is able to move equally

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:51.020
quickly in any direction. In the case of manipulability
is equal to zero, that indicates that motion

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.870
in one partition direction is not possible
and the three-dimensional ellipsoid has been

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.310
flattened into an elliptical plate.
