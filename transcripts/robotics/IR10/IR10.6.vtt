00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.100
Almost all electric motors are used in conjunction
with gearboxes. The reason for this is the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.330
electric motors produce relatively low torque.
They not particularly strong. However, they are

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.690
capable of rotating very very quickly. So
we can use a gearbox to trade off speed for

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.759
torque. Of course, there is no such thing
as a free lunch and a gearbox introduces some

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.459
inefficiency, there is some loss of power.
That power lost is in terms of heat and acoustic noise.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.340
If you use a bicycle you are probably quite familiar
with the concept of gearing. Electric motors

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.539
are capable of spinning very very quickly but they don't produce very much torque they are kind of weak.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.320
Now it's a bit like the problem of riding
your bicycle uphill. You want to trade off

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.699
a large number of rotations of the pedals
in order to reduce the load that you have

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.550
to exert on those pedals. You are trading
off a lot of speed for a large amount of torque.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.320
For an electric motor it's the same thing
and as with the bicycle you have a small sprocket

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.080
at the front on the pedals, and you have a
larger sprocket on the back wheel. So for

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.800
every rotation of the electric motor, we only
have half a rotation of the output shaft of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.830
the motor's gearbox. So the motor is spinning
quite quickly, the output shaft is rotating

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.990
rather slowly but the torque of the motor
is amplified by the gear ratio.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.790
Here we have a motor with a single stage reduction
gearbox. We call it a reduction gearbox because

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.940
for every rotation of the motor, the output
shaft rotates less than once. When we refer

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.950
to the two sides of the gearbox we refer to
as the motor side which indicated by the subscript

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.090
M and the load side indicated the subscript
L. The ratio of the gearbox is capital G and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.010
that's the ratio of the number teeth on the
big wheel to the number teeth on the little

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.910
wheel. And for a reduction gearbox G is greater
than one.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.630
The output speed omega L is equal to 1 on
G times omega N. So the output shaft speed

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.209
is lower than the motor speed. The output
torque tau L is equal to G times the motor

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.500
torque tau M so the output torque is greater
than the motor torque. These are the fundamental

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.099
equations that describe the characteristics
of a gearbox. It reduces the speed and it

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.099
increases the torque.
